00:00.000 --> 00:08.480
I can either say that my energy of the electron is minus E times E, because the electron charge is negative,

00:09.100 --> 00:13.460
or I can say, okay, I'm going to forget about that negative sign, because it creates a mess for me,

00:14.000 --> 00:15.900
and I'm going to just write it as E times E.

00:16.660 --> 00:19.740
In semiconductors, we follow the E times E convention.

00:20.740 --> 00:28.000
I don't know of a single textbook or a published piece of scientific literature where people do it the other way around.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.860
But the connection band is drawn at the bottom.

00:31.560 --> 00:36.920
The reason is that we generally associate higher energies with anti-bonding orbitals.

00:37.080 --> 00:38.020
We just learned about that.

00:41.260 --> 00:51.460
And since we actually associate that, we want to retain the idea of electrons being promoted to higher energy levels

00:51.460 --> 00:54.000
as the system being in a higher energy state altogether.

00:55.540 --> 00:58.000
So the convention in some sense is forced.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.180
It comes from that natural requirement.

00:59.720 --> 01:01.620
But there's nothing special about that convention.

01:02.120 --> 01:06.260
It is just that this convention is so universal that it basically becomes a protocol.

01:07.740 --> 01:08.080
Okay.

01:09.960 --> 01:14.520
I locate the top of the Willans band at E equal to zero.

01:15.600 --> 01:22.220
If I draw my band diagram now for real silicon, to that dashed line that you had,

01:25.360 --> 01:27.600
my Willans band energy,

01:28.000 --> 01:32.000
would be constant as a function of R.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
Why?

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
I am in the middle of the bulk silicon, right?

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
My band gap should not change.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
I'm inside the same material.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
Would you put X mark over here?

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
Hm?

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
You are pulling an X mark over here.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
I'm just giving you one part of it.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
You'll see how radically different this is.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
Sure.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
Yeah.

01:53.000 --> 01:58.000
So can we say that when I am having, say, in a continuous space,

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
I have two atoms, A and B,

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
even if I am changing their relative distance,

02:03.000 --> 02:10.000
A and B and all such atoms exist at a distance that nature intended them to.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Yes.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
So that means that distance is now fixed at five amps from the surface area.

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
So when we are actually varying R, we are just actually changing the reference at the end.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
The coordinate of the electron that is free to move around.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
That's the purpose of this particular part.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
So R is the position of electron relative to the atoms?

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
Any arbitrarily chosen atom.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
Because R equals zero in this case is not special.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
It's somewhere in the semiconductor.

02:35.000 --> 02:40.000
So where do we get to draw this diagram for ?

02:40.000 --> 02:45.000
Well, it's useful for calculating electron energies because that's all that we are doing here.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
So how do the electron energies distribute themselves?

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
Both this and this .

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
But there are different complementary pictures of that.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
That's the question.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
Okay.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
So band-iron, yes.

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
Atom, you are talking about real silicon here.

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
We are looking at the R coordinate of the electron.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
An electron that is free to move around.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
Now if it is in the valence band, it's not free to move around.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
It has the same energy no matter where you go in it.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
Yes.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
That is completely different from that.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
That R is different from this R.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
This is real silicon.

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
That was real silicon along a line and then all possible mathematical possibilities of that silicon.

03:24.000 --> 03:30.000
There was a distance between the two silicon atoms.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
Here is the position vector of the electron.

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
Is the position vector of the electron chosen from some other starting point?

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
Okay.

03:38.000 --> 03:42.000
So the energy that I need to remain in the valence band,

03:42.000 --> 03:47.000
the highest energy at which I remain in the valence band is the same regardless of where I am in the bulb.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
Right?

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
That's my bonding energy.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
Similarly, the energy,

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
the minimum energy at which the electron becomes free to move

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
is also the same regardless of where you are in the bulb.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
So the band diagram is actually pretty simple.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
It's two parallel lines.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
Everybody understood that?

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
So can you explain the top line?

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
This is E C.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
This is E V.

04:15.000 --> 04:20.000
But you said that E C varies as we go higher and higher in the conduction band.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
So there will be some bands here but we are not showing them.

04:22.000 --> 04:26.000
We are showing the lowest possible energy where the electron can become free.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
This is the band gap.

04:28.000 --> 04:34.000
This distance is the band gap.

04:34.000 --> 04:39.000
Any electron which is deeper in the bulb would have to go higher.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
It would have to pick up more energy or move more.

04:41.000 --> 04:46.000
Why don't we show the valence band and which is more negative,

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
the deeper we go into the valence band?

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
Yes.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
So within the bulb,

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
for the electron is more or less the same.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
That is what this diagram is.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
That is the definition of bulk is.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
Yes, so that is what the diagram is.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
So the diagram is implicitly saying that every point in the bulb is equivalent.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
That is only for the bulb.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
At the surface, things change.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
We won't do that.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
You might say this is a pretty boring diagram.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
Why bother with this at all?

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
It's just two parallel lines.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
The thing is devices don't consist of a single bulb.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
It consists of various things that are other than the bulb.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
Other materials that they interface may be two contacts or whatever.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
In which case,

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
this diagram would actually have discontinuities at both places.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
And then,

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
now I would become special by the way.

05:29.000 --> 05:34.000
Because how close or far away the electron is from that particular interface makes a difference.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
But in the bulb,

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
it makes no difference whatsoever.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
Okay, now let's talk about K,

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
which is a bit more interesting.

05:40.000 --> 05:45.000
Sir, suppose if we had any subband like above EC and below EV,

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
what would that jump indicate,

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
let's say,

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
EV1 and EV3?

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
That would just indicate that

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
this electron,

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
let's say somewhere there,

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
is more strongly bound to the iron force,

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
it is less likely to ever get promoted to being a free electron.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
Like an L-shell electron, for instance.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
So could it become free by just jumping into EC?

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
Yeah.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
So then what is the significance of that EC button?

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
EC is the lowest energy at which it can become free.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
So where it would go to?

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
It would go to that same conduction band?

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
It will go to the conduction band,

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
or it could go to a point higher than that.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
There would be other subband to this side as well.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
That is very much different from this one.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
They have different energies,

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
they have different mobilities.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
I will define that later.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
I spoke to some people.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
.

06:51.000 --> 07:03.000
.

07:03.000 --> 07:08.000
.

07:08.000 --> 07:15.000
.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
.

07:18.000 --> 07:36.680
I think somebody was saying parabolas here, so we do that only takes place near the edge

07:36.680 --> 07:40.240
of the conduction band and we are in right there, so when you go far away it won't capture

07:40.240 --> 07:41.240
the number of parabolas.

07:41.240 --> 07:46.660
So I am drawing the conduction band now and this is where the real difference in silicon

07:46.660 --> 07:48.660
and other materials become different.

07:48.660 --> 07:50.660
Why does the energy decrease?

07:50.660 --> 07:52.660
No, energy increases.

07:52.660 --> 07:58.660
Energy increases because remember we are drawing this diagram for increasing electron energies,

07:58.660 --> 07:59.660
conduction band.

07:59.660 --> 08:02.660
In the valence band also the energies increase downwards.

08:02.660 --> 08:04.660
That means it is more strongly bound.

08:04.660 --> 08:09.660
But something else is less strongly bound and I have not defined that something else.

08:09.660 --> 08:15.660
So an electron down here will be more strongly bound.

08:15.660 --> 08:16.660
Sir, but then you know.

08:16.660 --> 08:22.660
When it is more strongly bound why is the momentum more for that?

08:22.660 --> 08:25.660
I will define this momentum in a bit and then it will become clear.

08:25.660 --> 08:29.660
The momentum is not your normal momentum, it is what is known as the crystal momentum

08:29.660 --> 08:30.660
but it is okay.

08:30.660 --> 08:37.660
Sir, so if I say that if I am moving towards the bulk or away from the bulk then only my

08:37.660 --> 08:38.660
k will change, right?

08:38.660 --> 08:41.660
Because when I am moving along the bulk why should my…

08:41.660 --> 08:42.660
Let me define k.

08:42.660 --> 08:44.660
I am not defining k for you here.

08:44.660 --> 08:45.660
What are the really important points?

08:45.660 --> 08:49.660
See, here I did not need to define r because everything was constant, right?

08:49.660 --> 08:51.660
And how many of you have watched Star Trek?

08:51.660 --> 08:52.660
One, two.

08:52.660 --> 08:53.660
You know the queue?

08:53.660 --> 08:54.660
You remember that episode where they have that infinite road?

08:54.660 --> 08:55.660
The road never ends.

08:55.660 --> 08:56.660
That is basically the r existence.

08:56.660 --> 08:57.660
It is very, very boring.

08:57.660 --> 08:58.660
Everything is the same everywhere.

08:58.660 --> 08:59.660
Okay.

08:59.660 --> 09:00.660
This is a little bit different.

09:00.660 --> 09:01.660
So this is the k.

09:01.660 --> 09:02.660
This is the k.

09:02.660 --> 09:03.660
This is the k.

09:03.660 --> 09:04.660
This is the k.

09:04.660 --> 09:05.660
This is the k.

09:05.660 --> 09:06.660
This is the k.

09:06.660 --> 09:07.660
This is the k.

09:07.660 --> 09:08.660
This is the k.

09:08.660 --> 09:09.660
This is the k.

09:09.660 --> 09:10.660
This is the k.

09:10.660 --> 09:11.660
This is the k.

09:11.660 --> 09:12.660
This is the k.

09:12.660 --> 09:13.660
This is the k.

09:13.660 --> 09:14.660
This is the k.

09:14.660 --> 09:15.660
This is the k.

09:15.660 --> 09:19.660
So this is a valence band.

09:19.660 --> 09:23.660
Now I define something known as first breline zone.

09:23.660 --> 09:27.660
I will write it down here so that you guys can know this.

09:27.660 --> 09:38.660
First.

09:38.660 --> 09:39.660
Okay?

09:39.660 --> 09:42.660
First breline zone, FEEZ.

09:42.660 --> 09:43.660
denken WOMAN 2

09:43.660 --> 09:52.660
This is the distance along positive k. By the way, this diagram is going to become significantly

09:52.660 --> 09:59.660
more complicated. Right one is very simple. It's k in this direction, but we'll make it

09:59.660 --> 10:06.660
more complicated in a bit. This is the distance of periodicity. This is the g vector that

10:06.660 --> 10:11.660
we were referring to when we first started talking about dual space. This is the mod

10:11.660 --> 10:26.660
of the g vector. Now, beyond this space, this diagram repeats itself. Now you understand

10:26.660 --> 10:36.660
how this k thing is constructed? Each refers to a unit cell in k space. How do you define

10:36.660 --> 10:41.660
a unit cell in k space? I think the unit cell in real space carry over its Fourier

10:41.660 --> 10:46.660
transform or x-ray diffraction or whatever you have, and then you write down the corresponding

10:46.660 --> 10:55.660
reciprocal relations here. Okay? So in that, as I get further and further away from the

10:55.660 --> 11:05.660
center of the unit cell, my momentum naturally increases. Because what's my natural tendency?

11:05.660 --> 11:06.660
You know, for a bound electron.

11:06.660 --> 11:12.660
Stay within, you know, the bound state. Why do you need to go too far?

11:12.660 --> 11:14.660
So could you please repeat what you used to say?

11:14.660 --> 11:21.660
So as long as I have a bound electron, I have a certain punishment involved in trying to

11:21.660 --> 11:27.660
stray too far away from my bound state. There's an energy barrier to overcome. So I need a

11:27.660 --> 11:35.660
higher and higher momentum to actually overcome that. To pick up enough speed. In some sense,

11:35.660 --> 11:39.660
you've got a neutron star and then there is a planet that is in its gravity. It requires

11:39.660 --> 11:44.660
a lot of energy to get out. It's something similar to that.

11:44.660 --> 11:48.660
Okay. Now how do I draw the conduction band? And this is where there's a little bit of

11:48.660 --> 11:54.660
a head-scratching moment. Have you heard of things called direct and indirect bandgap

11:54.660 --> 12:00.660
semiconductors? No? Okay. This diagram is what really defines that. I'll need to find

12:00.660 --> 12:03.660
that. Just motivate this discussion.

12:03.660 --> 12:13.660
If, if, notice the word if. My conduction band looks like this. If, where the bottom

12:13.660 --> 12:19.660
of the conduction band and the top of the band are at the same k coordinate, chosen

12:19.660 --> 12:27.660
to be k equal to zero for simplicity, then I have a direct bandgap semiconductor. Silicon

12:27.660 --> 12:31.660
is not a direct bandgap semiconductor.

12:33.660 --> 12:41.660
If the bottom of my conduction band and the top of my valence band are at the same k coordinate,

12:41.660 --> 12:47.660
which we choose for convenience to be k equal to zero, then I have a direct bandgap semiconductor.

12:47.660 --> 12:53.660
So what this statement says is that this is the bandgap then, because that's the definition

12:53.660 --> 13:02.660
of what bandgap is. Right? Now, for silicon, so this is, should probably be a little bit

13:03.660 --> 13:09.660
confused discussion otherwise.

13:09.660 --> 13:21.660
I go to 0.85 FBZ. 85% of the way to the edge of the unit cell. And I'm not a forward direction

13:21.660 --> 13:30.660
yet. The direction also matters. That complication will come later. I go up a distance EGR. From

13:30.660 --> 13:32.660
this point, I draw a vertical line.

13:32.660 --> 13:33.660
Wow.

13:33.660 --> 13:37.660
And look at that point. That's the bottom of the conduction band.

13:37.660 --> 13:48.660
It looks a little bit like this. My drawing is not so great, but yeah. That's silicon band

13:48.660 --> 13:55.660
structure with only two bands. You were saying x coordinate matters.

13:55.660 --> 13:56.660
Yeah, it does matter.

13:56.660 --> 14:02.660
Okay. Now what does this mean practically? I'm just going to close with this example.

14:02.660 --> 14:09.660
Which is basically answer a technological question for you. How do LEDs work?

14:09.660 --> 14:17.660
Inject an electron and inject a counter carrier, which I'm going to call a hole in a lecture

14:17.660 --> 14:27.660
or two. They recombine and they get a photon up. If k is momentum, this carrier at this

14:27.660 --> 14:31.660
is the bottom of the conduction band here. And this electron, which is at the top of

14:31.660 --> 14:39.660
the valence band here, has different momentum. How different? 0.85 FBZ. Your FBZ is the unit

14:39.660 --> 14:42.660
of momentum. Okay?

14:42.660 --> 14:43.660
Yes.

14:43.660 --> 14:45.660
What is the momentum of a photon?

14:45.660 --> 14:48.660
H by 3.

14:48.660 --> 14:51.660
Momentum. Not energy.

14:51.660 --> 14:55.660
H by lambda.

14:55.660 --> 14:57.660
Energy divided by C, right?

14:57.660 --> 14:58.660
Yes.

14:58.660 --> 14:59.660
What is C?

14:59.660 --> 15:00.660
Speed of light.

15:00.660 --> 15:01.660
Speed of light.

15:01.660 --> 15:02.660
How much? 2.992.

15:02.660 --> 15:10.660
Very large number. So what is the momentum of a photon?

15:10.660 --> 15:18.660
Close to 0. Right? Now, okay. I've got one particle here, one particle here. I want to

15:18.660 --> 15:24.660
combine them and create another particle known as a photon. I must have energy conservation,

15:24.660 --> 15:27.660
but I must also have momentum conservation.

15:27.660 --> 15:28.660
Yes.

15:28.660 --> 15:34.660
So, let's say an electron at momentum k have a basically, it's a hole, but okay,

15:34.660 --> 15:36.660
a counter carrier at momentum 0.

15:36.660 --> 15:37.660
Okay.

15:37.660 --> 15:40.660
Net momentum of the initial state is what? 0.85 FBZ.

15:40.660 --> 15:41.660
Half of it.

15:41.660 --> 15:44.660
Final state is the photon, which has an energy 0 momentum.

15:44.660 --> 15:45.660
Oh.

15:45.660 --> 15:51.660
I can't satisfy that equation. That is the reason why silicon does not make good LEDs.

15:51.660 --> 15:55.660
It goes back, it is basically the corollary of that thing I told you about earlier, that

15:55.660 --> 15:59.660
silicon can be used to do some things, silicon will be used to do some things. This is an

15:59.660 --> 16:03.660
example of the silicon cannot be used to do some things. This is why people bother about

16:03.660 --> 16:06.660
gallium arsenide, gallium nitride and other direct bandgaps and other like this.

16:06.660 --> 16:11.660
So, that's why you use direct conduction band rather than core .

16:11.660 --> 16:15.660
We have to. We have to. How else do we use it at some momentum? So, let's figure out

16:15.660 --> 16:22.660
a way how to do that. Let's say that my ideal direct bandgap points would have been here,

16:22.660 --> 16:32.660
but this is silicon, so it is not here. So, I would basically have to find the process

16:32.660 --> 16:39.660
which takes away that momentum from this electron and allows this recombination to take place.

16:39.660 --> 16:45.660
It's a pretty large momentum. And any horizontal transitions on this actually refer to something

16:45.660 --> 16:51.660
I mentioned right at the beginning of this lecture, they refer to as phonons. Now, if

16:51.660 --> 16:52.660
semiconductors have to do something like this.

16:52.660 --> 16:57.660
So, if you have phonons with large energies available to 0.85 xz, this process would

16:57.660 --> 17:02.660
happen. But phonon energies in most semiconductors are actually very, very small. They are in

17:02.660 --> 17:05.660
milli electron volts, not electron volts either. Yes.

17:05.660 --> 17:11.660
Sir, we could also like feasibly maybe combine like an electron along a vertical

17:11.660 --> 17:17.660
grid. Is that also considered unfeasible? So, you see, if I extend this band further

17:17.660 --> 17:21.660
by the way. Is that energy considered unfeasible? That energy is very, very high.

17:21.660 --> 17:22.660
Okay.

17:22.660 --> 17:27.660
I mean, yes, you could get like extreme UV emission or something, a deep UV emission

17:27.660 --> 17:32.660
from silicon, but the efficiency would be so poor that it would not be worth making it.

17:32.660 --> 17:35.660
So, anyhow, we will continue this very interesting discussion next time.
