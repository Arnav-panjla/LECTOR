0	4240	So d by 18 of mn star ve
4240	5660	So ve is the same as before
5660	7740	What I have done over here is
7740	9720	I have stolen away the periodicity part
9720	13320	So I say that I write another set of equations
13320	15300	Where I modify the mass
15300	17880	So that I can throw away a vector on the right hand side
17880	20400	This is a mathematical operation
20400	24000	How do you modify the mass?
24600	27980	There are two ways in which people modify the mass
27980	31260	One way is to actually do really complicated calculations
31260	32400	Which we will go into later
32400	34500	Once I have defined both notions of effective mass
34500	36460	And the other which is always in this
36460	37560	Measured mass
37560	39680	How would you measure it?
40080	41240	How would you measure it?
43240	44300	That's what we don't do
44300	45880	That's why we have kind of reduced this equation
45880	49260	We don't want to go to the pathway of the first equation
49260	51320	We are desperately trying to avoid that
51320	51600	Yes
51600	55040	An equation is made for a single electron
55040	56820	Or it's for the mole of electron?
57480	57960	This
57960	58640	This equation
58640	59920	Good question
59920	61680	This question is
61680	64280	The second equation is what I would call a statistical equation
64280	66400	It refers to the average electron
66400	69800	So you expect most electrons to follow this
69800	70880	In that sense of an average
70880	73000	And we can do statistical averaging
73000	74960	Because we are starting with a very very large number
74960	76600	Of 10 to the power 23 of those electrons
76600	77000	Which is
77000	79260	The requirement of statistics
79260	82100	N represents electron
82100	83740	N always represents electron
83740	85500	Sub n always represents electron
85500	87080	Okay so
87080	87900	Yeah
87960	91360	Sir what does direction define energy?
91360	94200	Well your velocity is in a particular direction right?
94200	95800	That was earlier also right?
95800	96600	I am coming to that
96600	98440	Coming to that
98440	98840	So
98840	100280	What is F periodic?
100280	100680	Huh?
100680	102240	F periodic
102240	103160	F periodic is gone
103160	104200	Where is F periodic?
104200	106480	That is the whole reason we consider to be effective mass
106480	108680	Oh okay
108680	109600	Okay
109600	111640	So what is the loss of simplicity?
111640	114760	The mass is no longer a scalar now
114760	116240	Let us think in a little bit
116240	117840	Because we removed the periodicity so
117960	119720	Mass is no longer a scalar
119720	121440	You are in R3
121440	125760	I will have to define a different mass for each direction
125760	126560	Because
126560	127560	Okay think about it this way
127560	128720	You are moving in that direction
128720	130360	You are moving in different directions
130360	132720	Has a different set of inertia associated with it
132720	134800	How do we understand mass?
134800	135920	There is more scattering here
135920	139200	I say okay I am not going to worry about scattering arising from periodic sources
139200	141560	I am just going to lump it up into my
141560	143680	In a measure of inertia in that direction
143680	144960	So that is a direction dependence
144960	145960	So that is a direction dependence
145960	146960	So that is a direction dependence
146960	152440	And this is what is known as a kinematic definition of effective mass
152440	153680	There is going to be a different definition
153680	155480	It is going to be slightly more complicated
155480	157920	Unrelated to this
157920	159840	But often leads to similar numbers
159840	160840	But not always
160840	163160	The reason we need to understand that
163160	164920	But M star is a vector
164920	168760	M star is not a vector
168760	171640	It is a tensor
171640	174240	So basically it is a 3 by 3 matrix in R3P
176960	182080	All the matrixes have all the matrix properties
182080	185440	Right but then there are also cross terms
185440	189840	So whenever we talk about matrices
189840	192360	We say that it is diagonalizable under certain terms
192360	195880	So that you know you have got 0 above 0 at the bottom upper triangular lower triangular
195880	198200	And then there are 3 scalars along the diagonal
198200	200200	Similar to the vector matrix what we have
200200	203480	But in this case you cannot throw away the cross terms
203480	205480	It depends upon what kind of matrix actually you have got
205480	206440	How does that matrix work?
206960	207960	How does it look like?
207960	209960	We are coming to that
209960	214960	That is the project that allows me to present something
214960	218960	Okay now let us shell the discussion for a bit
218960	223960	And let me go into aspects which talk about construction of the lattice in the first place
223960	227960	Because the second definition arises naturally from there
227960	230960	Okay silicon atom
230960	233960	Let us imagine a universe where a single silicon atom exists
233960	234960	Okay
234960	236960	Obviously we cannot exist in that universe
236960	239960	Because we are not obligated in that
239960	244960	The shell structure for silicon is 1s2, 2s2, 2p6, 3s2, 3p2
244960	247960	We have seen this since I don't know 11th grade or something
247960	249960	Let us count is that 14?
249960	252960	Yeah 4 plus 6 plus 4
252960	256960	So I have got these two
256960	258960	What are the red and the blue lines?
258960	260960	Anybody want to guess?
260960	262960	Values?
262960	263960	Singularity
263960	264960	Singularity
264960	265960	Yes
265960	267960	Ground state and excited state
267960	269960	Because we have one single atom here
269960	275960	And the two atoms or rather you know the ion core is basically red
275960	276960	Which is at the bottom
276960	282960	And the signal electron which is free to move around is kind of shown schematically at the bottom
282960	284960	Okay
284960	287960	What is the red dot?
287960	289960	What is the red dot?
289960	290960	Red dot is the ion core
290960	293960	Basically 14 protons and a certain number of neutrons club together
293960	295960	What is the black dot?
295960	297960	Yeah that is the black dot
297960	300960	So what was the black?
300960	304960	The black dot is the electron that we are talking about right?
304960	305960	Oh
305960	307960	Huh?
307960	308960	Okay
308960	313960	The red core is essentially the nucleus of silicon
313960	316960	And the inner shell which don't participate in ground core
316960	317960	We don't care about
317960	318960	Everything except the valence shell
318960	320960	Valence shell is what we are interested in
320960	321960	Right?
321960	322960	Okay
322960	326960	Now let us now bring these two atoms closer to each other
326960	329960	I think you have seen in 11th grade what happens
329960	331960	Molecular orbital forms
331960	333960	Right?
333960	336960	And one of the properties of a molecular orbital are
336960	339960	That each energy level splits into two
339960	341960	Right?
341960	342960	Bonding and anti-bonding
342960	345960	The bonding being more stable and hence lower energy
345960	348960	So the ground state splits into two
348960	350960	Bonding and anti-bonding
350960	351960	And the excited state splits into two
351960	353960	So you have got four energy levels now
353960	357960	So two atoms brought together lead to four energy levels
357960	361960	I think we can start to see the beginning of a geometric sequence here
361960	362960	Sir
362960	363960	Yeah
363960	365960	Let us just consider one of the four energy levels
365960	366960	Yeah
366960	368960	Just to simplify
368960	371960	It will be too complicated to write four different
371960	372960	Okay
372960	378960	Now let us see what these states look like
378960	379960	You have all seen this
379960	381960	Atomic orbitals and how they form you know
381960	382960	Molecular orbitals
382960	386960	So there is an anti-bonding orbital which consists of a node
386960	390960	On the line connecting the two atoms
390960	391960	Sorry anti-node
391960	392960	Anti-node right
392960	394960	Because that is where the probability density is the minimum
394960	399960	And the bonding orbital means that there is more effective sharing of the electron cloud
399960	400960	Which forms a covalent bond
400960	401960	Hence the term bonding
401960	406960	And hence there is a node there
406960	408960	So this is LCAOQ
408960	410960	Kind of remember linear combination of atomic orbitals
410960	412960	That picture
412960	414960	Now let us bring in the number three
414960	416960	What is the below part?
416960	417960	Below part yeah
417960	423960	So the below part is basically the energy levels of potential
423960	426960	So each of these carriers carries different energy
426960	428960	It is from the textbook
428960	430960	It is pretty silly to take pictures according to the textbook
430960	431960	So what is this?
431960	433960	Why is there a well here?
433960	434960	Huh?
434960	435960	I mean the below part
435960	437960	There are two iron cores right?
437960	439960	The potential energy heads towards infinity
439960	441960	As the electron gets closer
441960	443960	So those two wells now that is in between
443960	446960	That is you know basically a shallow barrier
446960	449960	Okay
449960	451960	Now let us bring in the number three
451960	452960	Yeah
452960	455960	So you had these four states adding in two more
455960	456960	Eight
456960	460960	So let us see what happens
460960	461960	Eight
461960	462960	Right
462960	465960	So each splits into two again
465960	468960	Now let us carry this process forward
468960	472960	More atoms leads to more energy levels splitting
472960	474960	And if you have molar atoms
474960	476960	You can see this process you know
476960	478960	Going forth
478960	481960	And you basically get a quasi-continuum
481960	482960	Which is
482960	485960	Has a large separation in between
485960	487960	So this is your band gap
487960	489960	So conduction band on the top
489960	492960	Which is constructor and bonding orbitals
492960	494960	And the Williams band on the bottom
494960	496960	Constructing of your bonding orbitals
496960	497960	Okay
497960	503960	Okay let us go back
503960	506960	So more atoms lead to more energy levels splitting
506960	507960	And you notice that
507960	508960	You know
508960	510960	The way these gaps are opening up
510960	513960	As a result of that addition process
513960	515960	If I have a large enough
515960	517960	You know of course we cannot sit here and
517960	520960	Go to four, five, six and count up to ten
520960	522960	Partly three that is like silly
522960	525960	But this is what it results in
525960	527960	And these are bands
527960	530960	And the difference between the energy level
530960	533960	Of the lowest anti-bonding orbital
533960	535960	And the highest bonding orbital
535960	538960	Is known as the band gap
538960	542960	Mind you I have not defined what the x-coordinate is
542960	544960	Which is a different story
544960	547960	Only the bicoordinate
547960	548960	X-coordinate
548960	550960	Yeah it does
550960	552960	Massively
552960	555960	In some sense understanding basic semi-character
555960	556960	Is about understanding the x-coordinate
556960	558960	Yeah
558960	560960	You will figure out in a moment why
560960	561960	Yeah
561960	562960	Any questions
562960	563960	So what
563960	565960	So there are more energy levels above this
565960	566960	Uh
566960	569960	So essentially what is an anti-bonding orbital
569960	571960	Where electrons don't have to go
571960	574960	Because they have got higher energy
574960	577960	So even from basic principles we can argue that
577960	579960	Everything in blue over here is unoccupied
579960	581960	Electrons don't have to go there
581960	583960	So they don't have to come home
583960	585960	In organic semiconductors for instance
585960	587960	That is the term that is used
587960	589960	Highest occupied molecular orbital or HOMO
589960	591960	And lowest unoccupied molecular orbital
591960	592960	That is LUMO
592960	595960	But LUMO and HOMO are sharp levels in organics
595960	596960	These are bands
596960	599960	There is a difference
599960	601960	Because in molecular systems
601960	603960	You don't have very very strong interactions
603960	605960	Between different various molecules
605960	607960	That wonder why they interact with each other
607960	612960	And hence as a result bands don't form
612960	614960	Okay everybody understand where the band gap now comes from?
614960	621960	No
621960	624960	Silicon forms covalent bonds
624960	626960	Gemini forms covalent bonds
626960	627960	Most of the materials you come across
627960	629960	Kalium nitrate whatever
629960	631960	Forms covalent bonds
631960	632960	Bands of this nature
632960	636960	Or something very close to this will form
636960	637960	But if we talk about organic semiconductors
637960	640960	There is a different breed of semiconductors altogether
640960	642960	ALQ3 for instance
642960	643960	It is a complicated
643960	644960	You know
644960	647960	Are you capsized with a name which I don't care to remember or repeat?
647960	650960	You just understand what that name is
650960	652960	When you are writing down a paper
652960	654960	Put it once in a bracket and then forget about it
654960	655960	Is that kind of a name?
655960	657960	I am not a chemist
657960	661960	Those interactions between molecules and molecules are not covalent
661960	662960	They are wonder walls
662960	663960	Which means there are weak interactions
663960	666960	Weak interactions means less of energy splitting
666960	667960	Remember
667960	670960	We have to bring atoms very very close to each other
670960	672960	For this energy splitting argument to work
672960	674960	If they remain far apart from each other
674960	676960	Then the perturbation of one atom on the other
676960	677960	Is going to be very very weak
677960	679960	And as a result the splitting will not occur
679960	682960	So that's why bands don't form in organic semiconductors
682960	687960	So they basically behave as if they are like
687960	690960	I would say the electrons move through them
690960	692960	In a way of hopping transport
692960	695960	So one side it has an escape probability
695960	696960	It's like a trap
696960	697960	Then go to the next trap
697960	698960	Then go to the next trap
698960	701960	So unsurprisingly the conductivity in organic molecules is off
701960	705960	Much weaker than traditional semiconductors of this kind
705960	707960	But anyhow that's what you are going to learn in organic
707960	708960	Sir
708960	709960	Yeah
709960	712960	Sir so the valence band is essentially a bonding orbital
712960	713960	Just like a continuous
713960	716960	It forms a continuum because I got into it 23 years ago
716960	718960	Of course there are subbands inside
718960	720960	And we will learn about subbands later
720960	722960	When we need to
722960	725960	Because there is internal structure to these bands also
725960	729960	But we will come to that a bit later
729960	730960	Okay
731960	737960	So in keeping with the earlier terminology
737960	741960	Valence electrons live in valence band
741960	742960	That they are tightly bound
742960	744960	The K, L, M, shell etc
744960	748960	While the conduction electrons which are relatively free to move around
748960	750960	Live in the conduction band
750960	752960	And the business of understanding how much is in each
752960	753960	Will come from statistics
753960	757960	So we will get to that later
757960	759960	So another thing
759960	760960	This is now color convention
760960	762960	When it comes to doping
762960	764960	I will be using similar colors here
764960	767960	N is always represented as blue
767960	769960	P is always represented as red
769960	771960	And you will understand why in a moment
776960	779960	Obviously crystal structure arises from minimization of energy
779960	781960	All of you have seen this plot most likely
781960	782960	Right
782960	783960	Two atoms coming together
783960	785960	And you know what is the energy of the electrons
785960	787960	You know that are bound to that
787960	789960	So for hydrogen for instance
789960	795960	This energy minimization process leads to a bond length of around 74 picometers
795960	797960	For silicon that number is different
797960	800960	We have previously arrived at what 5 angstroms or something like that
800960	801960	Something like that
801960	806960	So each element has its own particular value
806960	809960	And this is now the silicon band structure
809960	811960	This is from your textbook again
811960	814960	So it divides up
814960	816960	So you see
816960	818960	What is the x axis here?
819960	821960	Anybody want to guess?
821960	823960	Distance between the two atoms
823960	824960	Yeah
824960	828960	So if I constructed a virtual silicon crystal
828960	832960	Where let's say the virtual is well advised over here
832960	838960	Where the distance between neighboring silicon atoms was not 5 angstroms
838960	840960	But was 10 angstroms
840960	843960	Then my band structure would look different
846960	848960	This is where real silicon exists
848960	850960	This dashed line
850960	854960	If I go further here then it would look a little bit like this
854960	859960	But it's virtual because nature does not construct that material for us
859960	865960	Because we have no way of keeping silicon atoms in any silicon crystal further apart than 5 angstroms
865960	867960	Because of lower energy
867960	868960	Yeah
868960	870960	Every system seeks its lowest energy
870960	871960	So it's not going to stay there
871960	874960	But this is basically more like a mathematical model
874960	875960	So what are those lines?
875960	877960	Like at one point you have two lines
877960	878960	Yeah
878960	880960	So these are what are known as sub-bands
880960	881960	Not very well defined here
881960	885960	So that is why most people find this figure coming so soon
885960	887960	The text local is a bit indigestible
887960	888960	But I'm just telling you
888960	890960	That there are two concepts here
890960	892960	States and electrons
892960	894960	At least we can agree on that
894960	899960	States refers to an electron can exist here
899960	902960	It doesn't mean that it will exist there
902960	904960	It can exist here
904960	906960	While on the other hand
906960	907960	An electron is an electron
907960	909960	It's either there or it's not there
909960	910960	It's a binary choice
910960	916960	So it's like the bonding electrons are there and electrons are there
916960	919960	In the anti-bonding also electrons can be there
919960	923960	But they're not usually there because they're anti-bonding orbitals to start with
923960	927960	Like if I have a surplus of electrons then it will be there
927960	930960	You'll have to be more clear about what you mean by surplus of electrons
930960	933960	I mean like for silicon there are only 14 electrons
933960	935960	So 4 electrons take place in this bonding-anti-bonding
935960	940960	If I had say a different atom with say 18 electrons
940960	942960	It'll also have a different band structure
942960	943960	For the same
943960	946960	If it had the same band structure then it would be okay
946960	948960	But again then we're talking about a virtual material
948960	949960	Yeah
949960	950960	Okay
950960	952960	So why is it always an integer multiple?
952960	954960	Because we count electrons
954960	956960	There's no such thing as 1.3 electrons
956960	959960	So it's an integer multiple of the number of electrons
959960	964960	I mean if you have zero electrons how can you have three minor states in the total state?
964960	970960	See four n states means that there are that many places for electrons to go set
970960	974960	But they're not sitting there at present
974960	979960	Do these states have to be equal in the conduction band and valence band or are they different?
979960	981960	They can be different, depends on your bandwidth
981960	986960	It depends on how many bonding and what is the energy level difference between bonding and anti-bonding and etc.
986960	988960	Again multiple depends completely
988960	992960	But what is the use of this diagram if we cannot create such a diagram?
992960	999960	The use of this diagram is for you to get an early flavour of that
999960	1006960	The concept of a state being available and the concept of an electron actually populating that state are two different ideas
1006960	1013960	We will based on, you know, driven or motivated by this diagram calculate the number of states available
1013960	1017960	And also the correspondence that is needed to populate those states
1017960	1021960	The combination of the two will give us certain important quantities
1021960	1025960	And that we want to possibly by next next lecture
1025960	1031960	Sir but in this diagram the only part of the diagram that we ever will really work with is the
1031960	1035960	The dashed line, the rest are all virtual materials
1035960	1042960	The dashed line, the vertical dashed line, that is real silicon, the rest is all virtual silicon
1042960	1044960	Right? Okay
1044960	1049960	Sir how from the graph are we integrating this four n and three n at any specific point?
1049960	1050960	Pardon?
1050960	1051960	Yeah?
1051960	1054960	Like if you take any point on this line, how are you integrating that?
1054960	1057960	Okay there will be two n states, okay there will be four n states or something
1057960	1059960	Because we are talking about fermions, right?
1059960	1061960	Electrons up spin and down spin
1061960	1062960	Yes
1062960	1063960	So two states
1063960	1066960	No I mean if you take any random point on this
1066960	1067960	Yes
1067960	1069960	Like there is no like order in this thing
1069960	1074960	It would be like a state and then there will be something less than a state as you go along
1074960	1076960	This is a continuum right?
1076960	1077960	This is a continuum
1077960	1078960	Yes
1078960	1080960	So it could be anywhere in here right?
1080960	1085960	No I mean you like they say it is four n states and then after that eight n states and then two n states
1085960	1088960	So there is no order, so how are you pinpointing the number of
1088960	1090960	Because that arises from silicon matter
1091960	1093960	It is a result of a calculation, yes
1093960	1098960	Sir also is there any concept of kind of on purpose pushing or pulling the silicon atoms
1098960	1100960	In different distances for ideal value?
1100960	1104960	Okay now you have raised an important question that you didn't mean to
1104960	1106960	Strain silicon
1106960	1109960	Like if I take silicon and I grow it on a substrate
1109960	1112960	Which is lattice mismatched
1112960	1113960	What will that do?
1113960	1115960	Mismatched as an exfoliator
1115960	1118960	Like it either has a lattice constant larger than five or smaller than five
1118960	1121960	Compressive or tensile strain
1121960	1126960	Which means that I will be constructing one of these virtual silicons there
1126960	1128960	But at least within certain number of monolayers
1128960	1130960	Because I know what happens when I go further away from the interface
1130960	1132960	We already discussed it actually
1132960	1137960	There it basically relaxes to bulk whether through formation dislocations or not
1137960	1138960	Because
1138960	1141960	Because silicon you cannot force a bulk
1141960	1145960	Like a large piece of silicon into becoming virtual silicon of some sort
1145960	1148960	It will only mean certain number of layers that is impacted by that
1148960	1149960	Yes
1149960	1153960	Sir in the previous diagram you actually
1153960	1155960	You don't have to go back sir
1155960	1157960	Like when we had bonding and anti-bonding
1157960	1160960	There was a lower line for bonding electrons
1160960	1162960	And the upper line
1162960	1166960	So the two lines for the actual spacing that we have
1166960	1168960	Where we have force n states
1168960	1170960	And force n electrons
1170960	1172960	Those are for the bonding ones
1172960	1173960	Then there is the bandgap
1173960	1175960	And then the upper two are for the anti-bonding ones
1175960	1177960	Yeah so force n states and zero electrons
1177960	1178960	Yeah
1178960	1182960	Mind you force n states and zero electrons is something that would occur at absolute zero
1182960	1186960	Where there is no energy available for the electrons to go up the production band
1186960	1190960	You will discover that in like a couple of slides but I am just putting it out here
1190960	1194960	In this graph here you can see what is a virtual silicon and what is a real silicon
1194960	1196960	Dash line is the real silicon
1196960	1197960	The vertical dash line
1197960	1198960	That is it
1198960	1201960	Because that is the lattice distance at which silicon condenses
1201960	1202960	There is no other distance
1202960	1204960	But there are three dash lines
1204960	1206960	Oh they are just reference lines
1206960	1209960	They were just showing okay that in that particular period there is no gap
1209960	1210960	Pardon
1210960	1215960	I think you are referring to this neck over here right
1215960	1216960	Yeah
1216960	1219960	So this is also a virtual silicon
1219960	1221960	But importantly there is no bandgap
1221960	1225960	So that is why it is indicated in that
1225960	1226960	Sir is there
1226960	1228960	What is the use for virtual silicon?
1228960	1229960	I just mentioned
1229960	1230960	You got a straight layer of silicon
1230960	1231960	You will have to go
1231960	1232960	That is how the moment created
1232960	1233960	But are there like
1233960	1234960	Oh yes
1234960	1237960	The effective mass for instance is different for straight silicon
1237960	1239960	You might need it for some application
1239960	1244960	What about for a very small layer like say 10-20 layers of silicon
1244960	1247960	Is it useful practically like can you build and you know
1247960	1254960	I would say that almost all the modern devices basically they rely almost critically on those 10-20 layers
1254960	1255960	The bulk does not matter
1255960	1259960	Sir so the casual speed will be different in a screened or compressed silicon obviously
1259960	1261960	They will have different mobilities different bandgap everything is different
1261960	1265960	So which one actually has a faster speed is there like a general input or
1265960	1266960	No
1266960	1275960	So for instance it depends upon whether the scattering in that particular direction changes enough so as to go below the bulk silicon scattering or not
1275960	1279960	Will depend upon the material how it is trained by how much it is trained
1279960	1284960	And whether there are any dipole-dipole interactions because if the underlying material is polar
1284960	1287960	It will have an influence it will lead to dipole scattering also
1287960	1291960	So it is a complex question depends on each system
1291960	1295960	Sir so we can does that actually math exist like is it
1295960	1297960	Math is very hard
1297960	1302960	See this is a case of where math is extremely hard but experiments are relatively easy
1302960	1305960	And importantly they get you the result you want
1305960	1307960	So yeah
1307960	1312960	Sir so maybe we can come up with a theory to explain this
1312960	1313960	It depends
1313960	1318960	So how are these states defined there and I am not looking at that what is that important state
1318960	1320960	But if I didn't show it to you you will understand exactly
1320960	1328960	Sir why are in the left and the right half symmetric like there are two atoms that go in the middle
1328960	1333960	Yeah
1333960	1336960	So it is asymmetric because this is asymmetric
1336960	1339960	But that would be same
1339960	1341960	You never know
1341960	1343960	Look this is the offshore distance
1343960	1348960	So it is a measure of how close the two atoms get and how far away they go
1348960	1350960	It is not whether I am making the lecture right
1350960	1352960	I hope that is clear
1352960	1356960	I am saying I have got an aggregator number of atoms
1356960	1358960	Which come and condense at a distance r
1358960	1359960	You never know
1359960	1361960	Tell me what happens at a distance r
1361960	1363960	That is what this diagram is
1363960	1364960	I don't know
1364960	1365960	I don't know
1365960	1366960	I don't know
1366960	1367960	I don't know
1367960	1368960	I don't know
1368960	1369960	I don't know
1369960	1371960	I don't know
1371960	1376960	This is the continuous
1376960	1379000	I think this is the urgent
1379000	1380960	This is the region
1380960	1381960	Right
1381960	1394600	N refers to the number of atoms that is
1394600	1397960	Nobody asked me that question
1397960	1399960	Well that comes
1399960	1400960	. . . . . 다
1400960	1401900	These back lines?
1402100	1402440	These ones?
1403100	1404880	So this is just a distance at which
1404880	1406320	virtual silicon does not have a band.
1408680	1411020	The property of the material at that particular distance.
1411160	1412980	It is just that if I left things B,
1413300	1414760	it would never condense into this form.
1415780	1417020	But you could say
1417020	1418720	that by going by the definition of metal
1418720	1421720	that a silicon that condenses it
1421720	1423000	with this interatomic distance
1423000	1423740	would act as a metal.
1425120	1425600	Is this enough?
1427100	1428160	So what was N here?
1428160	1431600	Well, there is no gap.
1432540	1433600	It depends upon
1433600	1436060	at what energy you are injecting carriers into it.
1436080	1438040	If the energy is much below
1438040	1439760	this level,
1440240	1441200	then it will be insulated.
1441340	1442820	If I am injecting anywhere above this,
1442820	1443500	then that doesn't matter.
1444820	1446220	But why doesn't silicon exist
1446220	1447640	in that virtual region,
1447720	1449660	but it exists after that virtual region?
1450680	1451340	No, no.
1451460	1453660	Silicon exists only at this line.
1454340	1454860	Nowhere else.
1456380	1457740	Everything else is virtual here.
1457980	1458120	Okay.
1458160	1461980	So can I construct silicon
1461980	1463900	that is an iron
1463900	1464680	and a fiber?
1466140	1466540	See,
1467540	1468080	first of all,
1468220	1470000	the further away I go from this black line,
1470080	1471420	the harder it becomes to construct that.
1471680	1471820	Right?
1472080	1473060	Everybody will give me that?
1473820	1475600	So even if I do strained air epitaxy,
1475640	1476860	I am not going to go very far away
1476860	1477580	from that black line.
1478660	1480740	So whether you can reach that neck region
1480740	1482020	using strained air epitaxy,
1482820	1484340	so far there are no reports.
1485980	1487980	So what was the capital of the drop?
1487980	1488280	Yeah.
1488280	1490680	What was the number of?
1490680	1491680	I don't understand.
1491680	1492680	.
1492680	1493680	.
1493680	1494680	.
1494680	1495680	.
1495680	1496680	.
1496680	1497680	.
1497680	1498680	.
1498680	1499680	.
1499680	1500680	.
1500680	1501680	.
1501680	1502680	.
1502680	1503680	.
1503680	1504680	.
1504680	1505680	.
1505680	1506680	.
1506680	1507680	.
1507680	1508680	.
1508680	1509680	.
1509680	1510680	.
1510680	1511680	.
1511680	1512680	.
1512680	1513680	.
1513680	1514680	.
1514680	1515680	.
1515680	1516680	.
1516680	1517680	.
1517680	1517720	.
1517720	1518380	.
1518380	1525420	So another thing,
1525700	1527940	because of the Williams band being
1527940	1529740	a collection of
1529740	1531700	random orbitals
1531700	1534780	and the conduction band being a collection of
1534780	1535960	anti-warning orbitals,
1537680	1538660	at the dashed line,
1538880	1539480	real silicon,
1541140	1543740	six n states are in the 3T orbitals.
1545340	1546760	We can do that.
1546760	1550100	and 3s has 2n states
1550100	1551540	because s orbital carries only 2
1551540	1554520	so there is an asymmetry
1554520	1555600	in the number of states available
1555600	1556760	between valence and conduction
1556760	1560720	in general
1560720	1563800	that asymmetry will not show itself
1563800	1564240	because
1564240	1567620	as we will learn later when we change the x coordinate
1567620	1568280	of this plot
1568280	1571380	the energies that are needed to
1571380	1574000	run into a case where these 2n or 6n
1574000	1574720	are insufficient
1574720	1577620	in general it won't arise
1577620	1579260	the energies needed are just
1579260	1581860	your silicon crystal will disintegrate
1581860	1582640	before you get to 2n
1582640	1585560	so let's say
1585560	1587040	I start populating these states
1587040	1589780	how much energy do I need
1589780	1591440	to actually fill them all up
1591440	1594020	more than the band gap
1594020	1596060	because you see these states are in a continuum
1596060	1598000	which means you need the band gap
1598000	1599380	energy to reach the band edge
1599380	1601300	I need more energy to go above that
1601300	1603760	and that keeps on rising
1603760	1606000	you will have the exact mathematical formula
1606000	1606660	for that in a bit
1606660	1611560	so counting of occupied and unoccupied states
1611560	1611960	we have done
1611960	1613500	so now let's define some basics
1613500	1615580	of what you have learnt regarding band structure
1615580	1618000	now here is where x coordinates
1618000	1619680	of that plot become important
1619680	1620480	I am going to draw
1620480	1622180	2 different
1622180	1625020	pictures here
1625020	1633340	energy
1633760	1639160	so the previous graph was also in the transformed space
1639160	1642260	or that was in the non-real space
1642260	1643460	no that was in real space
1643460	1644380	I was in real space
1644380	1646640	this is now in transformed space
1646640	1648980	I am going to that
1648980	1654220	so you see E versus R
1654220	1655920	there is another way of actually plotting this
1655920	1657140	that is in dual space
1657140	1658300	E versus A
1658300	1662420	now this is where x coordinates become dual space
1662420	1663740	what question is this plot
1663760	1665760	what information does this plot give you
1665760	1667760	what is the energy of my electron
1667760	1670760	versus the separation between the two atoms
1670760	1672760	versus the separation between the two atoms
1672760	1675760	or if I have already got a grain of silicon
1675760	1676760	I have an electron
1676760	1680760	I want to track its energy as it pops from atom to atom
1680760	1681760	right
1681760	1685760	but the thing is the electron is moving in real space
1685760	1686760	here
1686760	1690760	so this is known as
1690760	1693260	band diagram
1693260	1696260	it's important to get these terminologies right
1696260	1699260	that's what a band diagram is
1699260	1701260	this one is in dual space now
1701260	1703260	E versus K
1703260	1704260	this still
1704260	1707260	if I ask myself the same question
1707260	1710260	the information I would get from this particular
1710260	1711260	you know
1711260	1714260	plot would be
1714260	1717260	how much energy does my electron have
1717260	1720260	depending on how fast it is moving
1720260	1722260	so what is the energy of the electron?
1722260	1723260	not always
1723260	1724260	not always
1724260	1725260	not always
1725260	1727260	I'll show you in a moment
1727260	1730260	this plot assumes that the band
1730260	1732260	I should put a name over here
1732260	1734260	this particular plot is known as
1734260	1735260	band structure
1735260	1736260	band structure
1742260	1745260	so band diagram and band structure have two different means
1745260	1750260	only if I'm very very close to the minimum of the conduction band
1750260	1751260	and I'll define that in a moment
1751260	1757260	the further away I go that's no longer true
1757260	1758260	okay
1758260	1761260	now let's talk about a direct band gap semiconductor
1761260	1762260	okay
1762260	1772260	so it is traditional to locate the top of the valence band at equal to zero
1772260	1774260	okay
1774260	1778260	and we always draw this as well as this
1778260	1780260	for increasing electron energies
1780260	1781260	okay
1781260	1782260	this is a convention
1782260	1783260	this is a convention
1783260	1784260	you can do it in any other way
1784260	1786260	by the way it will be perfectly correct
1786260	1790260	but you will have to add negative signs throughout your entire semiconductor
1790260	1791260	everywhere
1791260	1793260	see it's like a voltage right?
1793260	1795260	if you multiply this with charge
1795260	1798260	I actually get something that has the dimensions of a voltage
