1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,480
I can either say that my energy of the electron is minus E times E, because the electron charge is negative,

2
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:13,460
or I can say, okay, I'm going to forget about that negative sign, because it creates a mess for me,

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,900
and I'm going to just write it as E times E.

4
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:19,740
In semiconductors, we follow the E times E convention.

5
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:28,000
I don't know of a single textbook or a published piece of scientific literature where people do it the other way around.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,860
But the connection band is drawn at the bottom.

7
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,920
The reason is that we generally associate higher energies with anti-bonding orbitals.

8
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,020
We just learned about that.

9
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:51,460
And since we actually associate that, we want to retain the idea of electrons being promoted to higher energy levels

10
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:54,000
as the system being in a higher energy state altogether.

11
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:58,000
So the convention in some sense is forced.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,180
It comes from that natural requirement.

13
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,620
But there's nothing special about that convention.

14
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:06,260
It is just that this convention is so universal that it basically becomes a protocol.

15
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:08,080
Okay.

16
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:14,520
I locate the top of the Willans band at E equal to zero.

17
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:22,220
If I draw my band diagram now for real silicon, to that dashed line that you had,

18
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,600
my Willans band energy,

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
would be constant as a function of R.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Why?

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I am in the middle of the bulk silicon, right?

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
My band gap should not change.

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm inside the same material.

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Would you put X mark over here?

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Hm?

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You are pulling an X mark over here.

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm just giving you one part of it.

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You'll see how radically different this is.

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Sure.

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Yeah.

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So can we say that when I am having, say, in a continuous space,

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I have two atoms, A and B,

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
even if I am changing their relative distance,

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:10,000
A and B and all such atoms exist at a distance that nature intended them to.

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Yes.

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So that means that distance is now fixed at five amps from the surface area.

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So when we are actually varying R, we are just actually changing the reference at the end.

38
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
The coordinate of the electron that is free to move around.

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
That's the purpose of this particular part.

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So R is the position of electron relative to the atoms?

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Any arbitrarily chosen atom.

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Because R equals zero in this case is not special.

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's somewhere in the semiconductor.

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So where do we get to draw this diagram for ?

45
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Well, it's useful for calculating electron energies because that's all that we are doing here.

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So how do the electron energies distribute themselves?

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Both this and this .

48
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
But there are different complementary pictures of that.

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
That's the question.

50
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Okay.

51
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So band-iron, yes.

52
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Atom, you are talking about real silicon here.

53
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
We are looking at the R coordinate of the electron.

54
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
An electron that is free to move around.

55
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Now if it is in the valence band, it's not free to move around.

56
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It has the same energy no matter where you go in it.

57
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Yes.

58
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
That is completely different from that.

59
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
That R is different from this R.

60
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
This is real silicon.

61
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
That was real silicon along a line and then all possible mathematical possibilities of that silicon.

62
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
There was a distance between the two silicon atoms.

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Here is the position vector of the electron.

64
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Is the position vector of the electron chosen from some other starting point?

65
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Okay.

66
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So the energy that I need to remain in the valence band,

67
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
the highest energy at which I remain in the valence band is the same regardless of where I am in the bulb.

68
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Right?

69
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
That's my bonding energy.

70
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Similarly, the energy,

71
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
the minimum energy at which the electron becomes free to move

72
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
is also the same regardless of where you are in the bulb.

73
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So the band diagram is actually pretty simple.

74
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It's two parallel lines.

75
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Everybody understood that?

76
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
So can you explain the top line?

77
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
This is E C.

78
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
This is E V.

79
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
But you said that E C varies as we go higher and higher in the conduction band.

80
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
So there will be some bands here but we are not showing them.

81
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
We are showing the lowest possible energy where the electron can become free.

82
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
This is the band gap.

83
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
This distance is the band gap.

84
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Any electron which is deeper in the bulb would have to go higher.

85
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It would have to pick up more energy or move more.

86
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Why don't we show the valence band and which is more negative,

87
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
the deeper we go into the valence band?

88
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Yes.

89
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So within the bulb,

90
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
for the electron is more or less the same.

91
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
That is what this diagram is.

92
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
That is the definition of bulk is.

93
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Yes, so that is what the diagram is.

94
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So the diagram is implicitly saying that every point in the bulb is equivalent.

95
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
That is only for the bulb.

96
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
At the surface, things change.

97
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
We won't do that.

98
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You might say this is a pretty boring diagram.

99
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Why bother with this at all?

100
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It's just two parallel lines.

101
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
The thing is devices don't consist of a single bulb.

102
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It consists of various things that are other than the bulb.

103
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Other materials that they interface may be two contacts or whatever.

104
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
In which case,

105
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
this diagram would actually have discontinuities at both places.

106
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
And then,

107
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
now I would become special by the way.

108
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Because how close or far away the electron is from that particular interface makes a difference.

109
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
But in the bulb,

110
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
it makes no difference whatsoever.

111
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Okay, now let's talk about K,

112
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
which is a bit more interesting.

113
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Sir, suppose if we had any subband like above EC and below EV,

114
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
what would that jump indicate,

115
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
let's say,

116
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
EV1 and EV3?

117
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
That would just indicate that

118
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
this electron,

119
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
let's say somewhere there,

120
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
is more strongly bound to the iron force,

121
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
it is less likely to ever get promoted to being a free electron.

122
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Like an L-shell electron, for instance.

123
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
So could it become free by just jumping into EC?

124
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Yeah.

125
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
So then what is the significance of that EC button?

126
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
EC is the lowest energy at which it can become free.

127
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
So where it would go to?

128
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It would go to that same conduction band?

129
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It will go to the conduction band,

130
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
or it could go to a point higher than that.

131
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
There would be other subband to this side as well.

132
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
That is very much different from this one.

133
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
They have different energies,

134
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
they have different mobilities.

135
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I will define that later.

136
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I spoke to some people.

137
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
.

138
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
.

139
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
.

140
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
.

141
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
.

142
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
.

143
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
.

144
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
.

145
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
.

146
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
.

147
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
.

148
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
.

149
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
.

150
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
.

151
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
.

152
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
.

153
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
.

154
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
.

155
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
.

156
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
.

157
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
.

158
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
.

159
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
.

160
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
.

161
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
.

162
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
.

163
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
.

164
00:06:51,000 --> 00:07:03,000
.

165
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
.

166
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:15,000
.

167
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
.

168
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:36,680
I think somebody was saying parabolas here, so we do that only takes place near the edge

169
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,240
of the conduction band and we are in right there, so when you go far away it won't capture

170
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,240
the number of parabolas.

171
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:46,660
So I am drawing the conduction band now and this is where the real difference in silicon

172
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,660
and other materials become different.

173
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,660
Why does the energy decrease?

174
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,660
No, energy increases.

175
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:58,660
Energy increases because remember we are drawing this diagram for increasing electron energies,

176
00:07:58,660 --> 00:07:59,660
conduction band.

177
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:02,660
In the valence band also the energies increase downwards.

178
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,660
That means it is more strongly bound.

179
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:09,660
But something else is less strongly bound and I have not defined that something else.

180
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:15,660
So an electron down here will be more strongly bound.

181
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:16,660
Sir, but then you know.

182
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:22,660
When it is more strongly bound why is the momentum more for that?

183
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:25,660
I will define this momentum in a bit and then it will become clear.

184
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:29,660
The momentum is not your normal momentum, it is what is known as the crystal momentum

185
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:30,660
but it is okay.

186
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:37,660
Sir, so if I say that if I am moving towards the bulk or away from the bulk then only my

187
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:38,660
k will change, right?

188
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:41,660
Because when I am moving along the bulk why should my…

189
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:42,660
Let me define k.

190
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,660
I am not defining k for you here.

191
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:45,660
What are the really important points?

192
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:49,660
See, here I did not need to define r because everything was constant, right?

193
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,660
And how many of you have watched Star Trek?

194
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,660
One, two.

195
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,660
You know the queue?

196
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,660
You remember that episode where they have that infinite road?

197
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,660
The road never ends.

198
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,660
That is basically the r existence.

199
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:57,660
It is very, very boring.

200
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:58,660
Everything is the same everywhere.

201
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,660
Okay.

202
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,660
This is a little bit different.

203
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,660
So this is the k.

204
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:02,660
This is the k.

205
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,660
This is the k.

206
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,660
This is the k.

207
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:05,660
This is the k.

208
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,660
This is the k.

209
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,660
This is the k.

210
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,660
This is the k.

211
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,660
This is the k.

212
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,660
This is the k.

213
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,660
This is the k.

214
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,660
This is the k.

215
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,660
This is the k.

216
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:14,660
This is the k.

217
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,660
This is the k.

218
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:19,660
So this is a valence band.

219
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:23,660
Now I define something known as first breline zone.

220
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:27,660
I will write it down here so that you guys can know this.

221
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:38,660
First.

222
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,660
Okay?

223
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,660
First breline zone, FEEZ.

224
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:43,660
denken WOMAN 2

225
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:52,660
This is the distance along positive k. By the way, this diagram is going to become significantly

226
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:59,660
more complicated. Right one is very simple. It's k in this direction, but we'll make it

227
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:06,660
more complicated in a bit. This is the distance of periodicity. This is the g vector that

228
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:11,660
we were referring to when we first started talking about dual space. This is the mod

229
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:26,660
of the g vector. Now, beyond this space, this diagram repeats itself. Now you understand

230
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:36,660
how this k thing is constructed? Each refers to a unit cell in k space. How do you define

231
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:41,660
a unit cell in k space? I think the unit cell in real space carry over its Fourier

232
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:46,660
transform or x-ray diffraction or whatever you have, and then you write down the corresponding

233
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:55,660
reciprocal relations here. Okay? So in that, as I get further and further away from the

234
00:10:55,660 --> 00:11:05,660
center of the unit cell, my momentum naturally increases. Because what's my natural tendency?

235
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:06,660
You know, for a bound electron.

236
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:12,660
Stay within, you know, the bound state. Why do you need to go too far?

237
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,660
So could you please repeat what you used to say?

238
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:21,660
So as long as I have a bound electron, I have a certain punishment involved in trying to

239
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:27,660
stray too far away from my bound state. There's an energy barrier to overcome. So I need a

240
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:35,660
higher and higher momentum to actually overcome that. To pick up enough speed. In some sense,

241
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:39,660
you've got a neutron star and then there is a planet that is in its gravity. It requires

242
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:44,660
a lot of energy to get out. It's something similar to that.

243
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:48,660
Okay. Now how do I draw the conduction band? And this is where there's a little bit of

244
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:54,660
a head-scratching moment. Have you heard of things called direct and indirect bandgap

245
00:11:54,660 --> 00:12:00,660
semiconductors? No? Okay. This diagram is what really defines that. I'll need to find

246
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,660
that. Just motivate this discussion.

247
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:13,660
If, if, notice the word if. My conduction band looks like this. If, where the bottom

248
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:19,660
of the conduction band and the top of the band are at the same k coordinate, chosen

249
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:27,660
to be k equal to zero for simplicity, then I have a direct bandgap semiconductor. Silicon

250
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:31,660
is not a direct bandgap semiconductor.

251
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:41,660
If the bottom of my conduction band and the top of my valence band are at the same k coordinate,

252
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:47,660
which we choose for convenience to be k equal to zero, then I have a direct bandgap semiconductor.

253
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:53,660
So what this statement says is that this is the bandgap then, because that's the definition

254
00:12:53,660 --> 00:13:02,660
of what bandgap is. Right? Now, for silicon, so this is, should probably be a little bit

255
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:09,660
confused discussion otherwise.

256
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:21,660
I go to 0.85 FBZ. 85% of the way to the edge of the unit cell. And I'm not a forward direction

257
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:30,660
yet. The direction also matters. That complication will come later. I go up a distance EGR. From

258
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,660
this point, I draw a vertical line.

259
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,660
Wow.

260
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:37,660
And look at that point. That's the bottom of the conduction band.

261
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:48,660
It looks a little bit like this. My drawing is not so great, but yeah. That's silicon band

262
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:55,660
structure with only two bands. You were saying x coordinate matters.

263
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,660
Yeah, it does matter.

264
00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:02,660
Okay. Now what does this mean practically? I'm just going to close with this example.

265
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:09,660
Which is basically answer a technological question for you. How do LEDs work?

266
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:17,660
Inject an electron and inject a counter carrier, which I'm going to call a hole in a lecture

267
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:27,660
or two. They recombine and they get a photon up. If k is momentum, this carrier at this

268
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:31,660
is the bottom of the conduction band here. And this electron, which is at the top of

269
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:39,660
the valence band here, has different momentum. How different? 0.85 FBZ. Your FBZ is the unit

270
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:42,660
of momentum. Okay?

271
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,660
Yes.

272
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,660
What is the momentum of a photon?

273
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:48,660
H by 3.

274
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:51,660
Momentum. Not energy.

275
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:55,660
H by lambda.

276
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,660
Energy divided by C, right?

277
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:58,660
Yes.

278
00:14:58,660 --> 00:14:59,660
What is C?

279
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:00,660
Speed of light.

280
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,660
Speed of light.

281
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:02,660
How much? 2.992.

282
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:10,660
Very large number. So what is the momentum of a photon?

283
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:18,660
Close to 0. Right? Now, okay. I've got one particle here, one particle here. I want to

284
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:24,660
combine them and create another particle known as a photon. I must have energy conservation,

285
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,660
but I must also have momentum conservation.

286
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,660
Yes.

287
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:34,660
So, let's say an electron at momentum k have a basically, it's a hole, but okay,

288
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,660
a counter carrier at momentum 0.

289
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,660
Okay.

290
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:40,660
Net momentum of the initial state is what? 0.85 FBZ.

291
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:41,660
Half of it.

292
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:44,660
Final state is the photon, which has an energy 0 momentum.

293
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:45,660
Oh.

294
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:51,660
I can't satisfy that equation. That is the reason why silicon does not make good LEDs.

295
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:55,660
It goes back, it is basically the corollary of that thing I told you about earlier, that

296
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:59,660
silicon can be used to do some things, silicon will be used to do some things. This is an

297
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:03,660
example of the silicon cannot be used to do some things. This is why people bother about

298
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:06,660
gallium arsenide, gallium nitride and other direct bandgaps and other like this.

299
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:11,660
So, that's why you use direct conduction band rather than core .

300
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:15,660
We have to. We have to. How else do we use it at some momentum? So, let's figure out

301
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:22,660
a way how to do that. Let's say that my ideal direct bandgap points would have been here,

302
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:32,660
but this is silicon, so it is not here. So, I would basically have to find the process

303
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:39,660
which takes away that momentum from this electron and allows this recombination to take place.

304
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:45,660
It's a pretty large momentum. And any horizontal transitions on this actually refer to something

305
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:51,660
I mentioned right at the beginning of this lecture, they refer to as phonons. Now, if

306
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,660
semiconductors have to do something like this.

307
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:57,660
So, if you have phonons with large energies available to 0.85 xz, this process would

308
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:02,660
happen. But phonon energies in most semiconductors are actually very, very small. They are in

309
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:05,660
milli electron volts, not electron volts either. Yes.

310
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:11,660
Sir, we could also like feasibly maybe combine like an electron along a vertical

311
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:17,660
grid. Is that also considered unfeasible? So, you see, if I extend this band further

312
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:21,660
by the way. Is that energy considered unfeasible? That energy is very, very high.

313
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,660
Okay.

314
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:27,660
I mean, yes, you could get like extreme UV emission or something, a deep UV emission

315
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:32,660
from silicon, but the efficiency would be so poor that it would not be worth making it.

316
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:35,660
So, anyhow, we will continue this very interesting discussion next time.

317
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,660
.

318
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:46,660
