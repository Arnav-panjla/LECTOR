WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.240
So d by 18 of mn star ve

00:04.240 --> 00:05.660
So ve is the same as before

00:05.660 --> 00:07.740
What I have done over here is

00:07.740 --> 00:09.720
I have stolen away the periodicity part

00:09.720 --> 00:13.320
So I say that I write another set of equations

00:13.320 --> 00:15.300
Where I modify the mass

00:15.300 --> 00:17.880
So that I can throw away a vector on the right hand side

00:17.880 --> 00:20.400
This is a mathematical operation

00:20.400 --> 00:24.000
How do you modify the mass?

00:24.600 --> 00:27.980
There are two ways in which people modify the mass

00:27.980 --> 00:31.260
One way is to actually do really complicated calculations

00:31.260 --> 00:32.400
Which we will go into later

00:32.400 --> 00:34.500
Once I have defined both notions of effective mass

00:34.500 --> 00:36.460
And the other which is always in this

00:36.460 --> 00:37.560
Measured mass

00:37.560 --> 00:39.680
How would you measure it?

00:40.080 --> 00:41.240
How would you measure it?

00:43.240 --> 00:44.300
That's what we don't do

00:44.300 --> 00:45.880
That's why we have kind of reduced this equation

00:45.880 --> 00:49.260
We don't want to go to the pathway of the first equation

00:49.260 --> 00:51.320
We are desperately trying to avoid that

00:51.320 --> 00:51.600
Yes

00:51.600 --> 00:55.040
An equation is made for a single electron

00:55.040 --> 00:56.820
Or it's for the mole of electron?

00:57.480 --> 00:57.960
This

00:57.960 --> 00:58.640
This equation

00:58.640 --> 00:59.920
Good question

00:59.920 --> 01:01.680
This question is

01:01.680 --> 01:04.280
The second equation is what I would call a statistical equation

01:04.280 --> 01:06.400
It refers to the average electron

01:06.400 --> 01:09.800
So you expect most electrons to follow this

01:09.800 --> 01:10.880
In that sense of an average

01:10.880 --> 01:13.000
And we can do statistical averaging

01:13.000 --> 01:14.960
Because we are starting with a very very large number

01:14.960 --> 01:16.600
Of 10 to the power 23 of those electrons

01:16.600 --> 01:17.000
Which is

01:17.000 --> 01:19.260
The requirement of statistics

01:19.260 --> 01:22.100
N represents electron

01:22.100 --> 01:23.740
N always represents electron

01:23.740 --> 01:25.500
Sub n always represents electron

01:25.500 --> 01:27.080
Okay so

01:27.080 --> 01:27.900
Yeah

01:27.960 --> 01:31.360
Sir what does direction define energy?

01:31.360 --> 01:34.200
Well your velocity is in a particular direction right?

01:34.200 --> 01:35.800
That was earlier also right?

01:35.800 --> 01:36.600
I am coming to that

01:36.600 --> 01:38.440
Coming to that

01:38.440 --> 01:38.840
So

01:38.840 --> 01:40.280
What is F periodic?

01:40.280 --> 01:40.680
Huh?

01:40.680 --> 01:42.240
F periodic

01:42.240 --> 01:43.160
F periodic is gone

01:43.160 --> 01:44.200
Where is F periodic?

01:44.200 --> 01:46.480
That is the whole reason we consider to be effective mass

01:46.480 --> 01:48.680
Oh okay

01:48.680 --> 01:49.600
Okay

01:49.600 --> 01:51.640
So what is the loss of simplicity?

01:51.640 --> 01:54.760
The mass is no longer a scalar now

01:54.760 --> 01:56.240
Let us think in a little bit

01:56.240 --> 01:57.840
Because we removed the periodicity so

01:57.960 --> 01:59.720
Mass is no longer a scalar

01:59.720 --> 02:01.440
You are in R3

02:01.440 --> 02:05.760
I will have to define a different mass for each direction

02:05.760 --> 02:06.560
Because

02:06.560 --> 02:07.560
Okay think about it this way

02:07.560 --> 02:08.720
You are moving in that direction

02:08.720 --> 02:10.360
You are moving in different directions

02:10.360 --> 02:12.720
Has a different set of inertia associated with it

02:12.720 --> 02:14.800
How do we understand mass?

02:14.800 --> 02:15.920
There is more scattering here

02:15.920 --> 02:19.200
I say okay I am not going to worry about scattering arising from periodic sources

02:19.200 --> 02:21.560
I am just going to lump it up into my

02:21.560 --> 02:23.680
In a measure of inertia in that direction

02:23.680 --> 02:24.960
So that is a direction dependence

02:24.960 --> 02:25.960
So that is a direction dependence

02:25.960 --> 02:26.960
So that is a direction dependence

02:26.960 --> 02:32.440
And this is what is known as a kinematic definition of effective mass

02:32.440 --> 02:33.680
There is going to be a different definition

02:33.680 --> 02:35.480
It is going to be slightly more complicated

02:35.480 --> 02:37.920
Unrelated to this

02:37.920 --> 02:39.840
But often leads to similar numbers

02:39.840 --> 02:40.840
But not always

02:40.840 --> 02:43.160
The reason we need to understand that

02:43.160 --> 02:44.920
But M star is a vector

02:44.920 --> 02:48.760
M star is not a vector

02:48.760 --> 02:51.640
It is a tensor

02:51.640 --> 02:54.240
So basically it is a 3 by 3 matrix in R3P

02:56.960 --> 03:02.080
All the matrixes have all the matrix properties

03:02.080 --> 03:05.440
Right but then there are also cross terms

03:05.440 --> 03:09.840
So whenever we talk about matrices

03:09.840 --> 03:12.360
We say that it is diagonalizable under certain terms

03:12.360 --> 03:15.880
So that you know you have got 0 above 0 at the bottom upper triangular lower triangular

03:15.880 --> 03:18.200
And then there are 3 scalars along the diagonal

03:18.200 --> 03:20.200
Similar to the vector matrix what we have

03:20.200 --> 03:23.480
But in this case you cannot throw away the cross terms

03:23.480 --> 03:25.480
It depends upon what kind of matrix actually you have got

03:25.480 --> 03:26.440
How does that matrix work?

03:26.960 --> 03:27.960
How does it look like?

03:27.960 --> 03:29.960
We are coming to that

03:29.960 --> 03:34.960
That is the project that allows me to present something

03:34.960 --> 03:38.960
Okay now let us shell the discussion for a bit

03:38.960 --> 03:43.960
And let me go into aspects which talk about construction of the lattice in the first place

03:43.960 --> 03:47.960
Because the second definition arises naturally from there

03:47.960 --> 03:50.960
Okay silicon atom

03:50.960 --> 03:53.960
Let us imagine a universe where a single silicon atom exists

03:53.960 --> 03:54.960
Okay

03:54.960 --> 03:56.960
Obviously we cannot exist in that universe

03:56.960 --> 03:59.960
Because we are not obligated in that

03:59.960 --> 04:04.960
The shell structure for silicon is 1s2, 2s2, 2p6, 3s2, 3p2

04:04.960 --> 04:07.960
We have seen this since I don't know 11th grade or something

04:07.960 --> 04:09.960
Let us count is that 14?

04:09.960 --> 04:12.960
Yeah 4 plus 6 plus 4

04:12.960 --> 04:16.960
So I have got these two

04:16.960 --> 04:18.960
What are the red and the blue lines?

04:18.960 --> 04:20.960
Anybody want to guess?

04:20.960 --> 04:22.960
Values?

04:22.960 --> 04:23.960
Singularity

04:23.960 --> 04:24.960
Singularity

04:24.960 --> 04:25.960
Yes

04:25.960 --> 04:27.960
Ground state and excited state

04:27.960 --> 04:29.960
Because we have one single atom here

04:29.960 --> 04:35.960
And the two atoms or rather you know the ion core is basically red

04:35.960 --> 04:36.960
Which is at the bottom

04:36.960 --> 04:42.960
And the signal electron which is free to move around is kind of shown schematically at the bottom

04:42.960 --> 04:44.960
Okay

04:44.960 --> 04:47.960
What is the red dot?

04:47.960 --> 04:49.960
What is the red dot?

04:49.960 --> 04:50.960
Red dot is the ion core

04:50.960 --> 04:53.960
Basically 14 protons and a certain number of neutrons club together

04:53.960 --> 04:55.960
What is the black dot?

04:55.960 --> 04:57.960
Yeah that is the black dot

04:57.960 --> 05:00.960
So what was the black?

05:00.960 --> 05:04.960
The black dot is the electron that we are talking about right?

05:04.960 --> 05:05.960
Oh

05:05.960 --> 05:07.960
Huh?

05:07.960 --> 05:08.960
Okay

05:08.960 --> 05:13.960
The red core is essentially the nucleus of silicon

05:13.960 --> 05:16.960
And the inner shell which don't participate in ground core

05:16.960 --> 05:17.960
We don't care about

05:17.960 --> 05:18.960
Everything except the valence shell

05:18.960 --> 05:20.960
Valence shell is what we are interested in

05:20.960 --> 05:21.960
Right?

05:21.960 --> 05:22.960
Okay

05:22.960 --> 05:26.960
Now let us now bring these two atoms closer to each other

05:26.960 --> 05:29.960
I think you have seen in 11th grade what happens

05:29.960 --> 05:31.960
Molecular orbital forms

05:31.960 --> 05:33.960
Right?

05:33.960 --> 05:36.960
And one of the properties of a molecular orbital are

05:36.960 --> 05:39.960
That each energy level splits into two

05:39.960 --> 05:41.960
Right?

05:41.960 --> 05:42.960
Bonding and anti-bonding

05:42.960 --> 05:45.960
The bonding being more stable and hence lower energy

05:45.960 --> 05:48.960
So the ground state splits into two

05:48.960 --> 05:50.960
Bonding and anti-bonding

05:50.960 --> 05:51.960
And the excited state splits into two

05:51.960 --> 05:53.960
So you have got four energy levels now

05:53.960 --> 05:57.960
So two atoms brought together lead to four energy levels

05:57.960 --> 06:01.960
I think we can start to see the beginning of a geometric sequence here

06:01.960 --> 06:02.960
Sir

06:02.960 --> 06:03.960
Yeah

06:03.960 --> 06:05.960
Let us just consider one of the four energy levels

06:05.960 --> 06:06.960
Yeah

06:06.960 --> 06:08.960
Just to simplify

06:08.960 --> 06:11.960
It will be too complicated to write four different

06:11.960 --> 06:12.960
Okay

06:12.960 --> 06:18.960
Now let us see what these states look like

06:18.960 --> 06:19.960
You have all seen this

06:19.960 --> 06:21.960
Atomic orbitals and how they form you know

06:21.960 --> 06:22.960
Molecular orbitals

06:22.960 --> 06:26.960
So there is an anti-bonding orbital which consists of a node

06:26.960 --> 06:30.960
On the line connecting the two atoms

06:30.960 --> 06:31.960
Sorry anti-node

06:31.960 --> 06:32.960
Anti-node right

06:32.960 --> 06:34.960
Because that is where the probability density is the minimum

06:34.960 --> 06:39.960
And the bonding orbital means that there is more effective sharing of the electron cloud

06:39.960 --> 06:40.960
Which forms a covalent bond

06:40.960 --> 06:41.960
Hence the term bonding

06:41.960 --> 06:46.960
And hence there is a node there

06:46.960 --> 06:48.960
So this is LCAOQ

06:48.960 --> 06:50.960
Kind of remember linear combination of atomic orbitals

06:50.960 --> 06:52.960
That picture

06:52.960 --> 06:54.960
Now let us bring in the number three

06:54.960 --> 06:56.960
What is the below part?

06:56.960 --> 06:57.960
Below part yeah

06:57.960 --> 07:03.960
So the below part is basically the energy levels of potential

07:03.960 --> 07:06.960
So each of these carriers carries different energy

07:06.960 --> 07:08.960
It is from the textbook

07:08.960 --> 07:10.960
It is pretty silly to take pictures according to the textbook

07:10.960 --> 07:11.960
So what is this?

07:11.960 --> 07:13.960
Why is there a well here?

07:13.960 --> 07:14.960
Huh?

07:14.960 --> 07:15.960
I mean the below part

07:15.960 --> 07:17.960
There are two iron cores right?

07:17.960 --> 07:19.960
The potential energy heads towards infinity

07:19.960 --> 07:21.960
As the electron gets closer

07:21.960 --> 07:23.960
So those two wells now that is in between

07:23.960 --> 07:26.960
That is you know basically a shallow barrier

07:26.960 --> 07:29.960
Okay

07:29.960 --> 07:31.960
Now let us bring in the number three

07:31.960 --> 07:32.960
Yeah

07:32.960 --> 07:35.960
So you had these four states adding in two more

07:35.960 --> 07:36.960
Eight

07:36.960 --> 07:40.960
So let us see what happens

07:40.960 --> 07:41.960
Eight

07:41.960 --> 07:42.960
Right

07:42.960 --> 07:45.960
So each splits into two again

07:45.960 --> 07:48.960
Now let us carry this process forward

07:48.960 --> 07:52.960
More atoms leads to more energy levels splitting

07:52.960 --> 07:54.960
And if you have molar atoms

07:54.960 --> 07:56.960
You can see this process you know

07:56.960 --> 07:58.960
Going forth

07:58.960 --> 08:01.960
And you basically get a quasi-continuum

08:01.960 --> 08:02.960
Which is

08:02.960 --> 08:05.960
Has a large separation in between

08:05.960 --> 08:07.960
So this is your band gap

08:07.960 --> 08:09.960
So conduction band on the top

08:09.960 --> 08:12.960
Which is constructor and bonding orbitals

08:12.960 --> 08:14.960
And the Williams band on the bottom

08:14.960 --> 08:16.960
Constructing of your bonding orbitals

08:16.960 --> 08:17.960
Okay

08:17.960 --> 08:23.960
Okay let us go back

08:23.960 --> 08:26.960
So more atoms lead to more energy levels splitting

08:26.960 --> 08:27.960
And you notice that

08:27.960 --> 08:28.960
You know

08:28.960 --> 08:30.960
The way these gaps are opening up

08:30.960 --> 08:33.960
As a result of that addition process

08:33.960 --> 08:35.960
If I have a large enough

08:35.960 --> 08:37.960
You know of course we cannot sit here and

08:37.960 --> 08:40.960
Go to four, five, six and count up to ten

08:40.960 --> 08:42.960
Partly three that is like silly

08:42.960 --> 08:45.960
But this is what it results in

08:45.960 --> 08:47.960
And these are bands

08:47.960 --> 08:50.960
And the difference between the energy level

08:50.960 --> 08:53.960
Of the lowest anti-bonding orbital

08:53.960 --> 08:55.960
And the highest bonding orbital

08:55.960 --> 08:58.960
Is known as the band gap

08:58.960 --> 09:02.960
Mind you I have not defined what the x-coordinate is

09:02.960 --> 09:04.960
Which is a different story

09:04.960 --> 09:07.960
Only the bicoordinate

09:07.960 --> 09:08.960
X-coordinate

09:08.960 --> 09:10.960
Yeah it does

09:10.960 --> 09:12.960
Massively

09:12.960 --> 09:15.960
In some sense understanding basic semi-character

09:15.960 --> 09:16.960
Is about understanding the x-coordinate

09:16.960 --> 09:18.960
Yeah

09:18.960 --> 09:20.960
You will figure out in a moment why

09:20.960 --> 09:21.960
Yeah

09:21.960 --> 09:22.960
Any questions

09:22.960 --> 09:23.960
So what

09:23.960 --> 09:25.960
So there are more energy levels above this

09:25.960 --> 09:26.960
Uh

09:26.960 --> 09:29.960
So essentially what is an anti-bonding orbital

09:29.960 --> 09:31.960
Where electrons don't have to go

09:31.960 --> 09:34.960
Because they have got higher energy

09:34.960 --> 09:37.960
So even from basic principles we can argue that

09:37.960 --> 09:39.960
Everything in blue over here is unoccupied

09:39.960 --> 09:41.960
Electrons don't have to go there

09:41.960 --> 09:43.960
So they don't have to come home

09:43.960 --> 09:45.960
In organic semiconductors for instance

09:45.960 --> 09:47.960
That is the term that is used

09:47.960 --> 09:49.960
Highest occupied molecular orbital or HOMO

09:49.960 --> 09:51.960
And lowest unoccupied molecular orbital

09:51.960 --> 09:52.960
That is LUMO

09:52.960 --> 09:55.960
But LUMO and HOMO are sharp levels in organics

09:55.960 --> 09:56.960
These are bands

09:56.960 --> 09:59.960
There is a difference

09:59.960 --> 10:01.960
Because in molecular systems

10:01.960 --> 10:03.960
You don't have very very strong interactions

10:03.960 --> 10:05.960
Between different various molecules

10:05.960 --> 10:07.960
That wonder why they interact with each other

10:07.960 --> 10:12.960
And hence as a result bands don't form

10:12.960 --> 10:14.960
Okay everybody understand where the band gap now comes from?

10:14.960 --> 10:21.960
No

10:21.960 --> 10:24.960
Silicon forms covalent bonds

10:24.960 --> 10:26.960
Gemini forms covalent bonds

10:26.960 --> 10:27.960
Most of the materials you come across

10:27.960 --> 10:29.960
Kalium nitrate whatever

10:29.960 --> 10:31.960
Forms covalent bonds

10:31.960 --> 10:32.960
Bands of this nature

10:32.960 --> 10:36.960
Or something very close to this will form

10:36.960 --> 10:37.960
But if we talk about organic semiconductors

10:37.960 --> 10:40.960
There is a different breed of semiconductors altogether

10:40.960 --> 10:42.960
ALQ3 for instance

10:42.960 --> 10:43.960
It is a complicated

10:43.960 --> 10:44.960
You know

10:44.960 --> 10:47.960
Are you capsized with a name which I don't care to remember or repeat?

10:47.960 --> 10:50.960
You just understand what that name is

10:50.960 --> 10:52.960
When you are writing down a paper

10:52.960 --> 10:54.960
Put it once in a bracket and then forget about it

10:54.960 --> 10:55.960
Is that kind of a name?

10:55.960 --> 10:57.960
I am not a chemist

10:57.960 --> 11:01.960
Those interactions between molecules and molecules are not covalent

11:01.960 --> 11:02.960
They are wonder walls

11:02.960 --> 11:03.960
Which means there are weak interactions

11:03.960 --> 11:06.960
Weak interactions means less of energy splitting

11:06.960 --> 11:07.960
Remember

11:07.960 --> 11:10.960
We have to bring atoms very very close to each other

11:10.960 --> 11:12.960
For this energy splitting argument to work

11:12.960 --> 11:14.960
If they remain far apart from each other

11:14.960 --> 11:16.960
Then the perturbation of one atom on the other

11:16.960 --> 11:17.960
Is going to be very very weak

11:17.960 --> 11:19.960
And as a result the splitting will not occur

11:19.960 --> 11:22.960
So that's why bands don't form in organic semiconductors

11:22.960 --> 11:27.960
So they basically behave as if they are like

11:27.960 --> 11:30.960
I would say the electrons move through them

11:30.960 --> 11:32.960
In a way of hopping transport

11:32.960 --> 11:35.960
So one side it has an escape probability

11:35.960 --> 11:36.960
It's like a trap

11:36.960 --> 11:37.960
Then go to the next trap

11:37.960 --> 11:38.960
Then go to the next trap

11:38.960 --> 11:41.960
So unsurprisingly the conductivity in organic molecules is off

11:41.960 --> 11:45.960
Much weaker than traditional semiconductors of this kind

11:45.960 --> 11:47.960
But anyhow that's what you are going to learn in organic

11:47.960 --> 11:48.960
Sir

11:48.960 --> 11:49.960
Yeah

11:49.960 --> 11:52.960
Sir so the valence band is essentially a bonding orbital

11:52.960 --> 11:53.960
Just like a continuous

11:53.960 --> 11:56.960
It forms a continuum because I got into it 23 years ago

11:56.960 --> 11:58.960
Of course there are subbands inside

11:58.960 --> 12:00.960
And we will learn about subbands later

12:00.960 --> 12:02.960
When we need to

12:02.960 --> 12:05.960
Because there is internal structure to these bands also

12:05.960 --> 12:09.960
But we will come to that a bit later

12:09.960 --> 12:10.960
Okay

12:11.960 --> 12:17.960
So in keeping with the earlier terminology

12:17.960 --> 12:21.960
Valence electrons live in valence band

12:21.960 --> 12:22.960
That they are tightly bound

12:22.960 --> 12:24.960
The K, L, M, shell etc

12:24.960 --> 12:28.960
While the conduction electrons which are relatively free to move around

12:28.960 --> 12:30.960
Live in the conduction band

12:30.960 --> 12:32.960
And the business of understanding how much is in each

12:32.960 --> 12:33.960
Will come from statistics

12:33.960 --> 12:37.960
So we will get to that later

12:37.960 --> 12:39.960
So another thing

12:39.960 --> 12:40.960
This is now color convention

12:40.960 --> 12:42.960
When it comes to doping

12:42.960 --> 12:44.960
I will be using similar colors here

12:44.960 --> 12:47.960
N is always represented as blue

12:47.960 --> 12:49.960
P is always represented as red

12:49.960 --> 12:51.960
And you will understand why in a moment

12:56.960 --> 12:59.960
Obviously crystal structure arises from minimization of energy

12:59.960 --> 13:01.960
All of you have seen this plot most likely

13:01.960 --> 13:02.960
Right

13:02.960 --> 13:03.960
Two atoms coming together

13:03.960 --> 13:05.960
And you know what is the energy of the electrons

13:05.960 --> 13:07.960
You know that are bound to that

13:07.960 --> 13:09.960
So for hydrogen for instance

13:09.960 --> 13:15.960
This energy minimization process leads to a bond length of around 74 picometers

13:15.960 --> 13:17.960
For silicon that number is different

13:17.960 --> 13:20.960
We have previously arrived at what 5 angstroms or something like that

13:20.960 --> 13:21.960
Something like that

13:21.960 --> 13:26.960
So each element has its own particular value

13:26.960 --> 13:29.960
And this is now the silicon band structure

13:29.960 --> 13:31.960
This is from your textbook again

13:31.960 --> 13:34.960
So it divides up

13:34.960 --> 13:36.960
So you see

13:36.960 --> 13:38.960
What is the x axis here?

13:39.960 --> 13:41.960
Anybody want to guess?

13:41.960 --> 13:43.960
Distance between the two atoms

13:43.960 --> 13:44.960
Yeah

13:44.960 --> 13:48.960
So if I constructed a virtual silicon crystal

13:48.960 --> 13:52.960
Where let's say the virtual is well advised over here

13:52.960 --> 13:58.960
Where the distance between neighboring silicon atoms was not 5 angstroms

13:58.960 --> 14:00.960
But was 10 angstroms

14:00.960 --> 14:03.960
Then my band structure would look different

14:06.960 --> 14:08.960
This is where real silicon exists

14:08.960 --> 14:10.960
This dashed line

14:10.960 --> 14:14.960
If I go further here then it would look a little bit like this

14:14.960 --> 14:19.960
But it's virtual because nature does not construct that material for us

14:19.960 --> 14:25.960
Because we have no way of keeping silicon atoms in any silicon crystal further apart than 5 angstroms

14:25.960 --> 14:27.960
Because of lower energy

14:27.960 --> 14:28.960
Yeah

14:28.960 --> 14:30.960
Every system seeks its lowest energy

14:30.960 --> 14:31.960
So it's not going to stay there

14:31.960 --> 14:34.960
But this is basically more like a mathematical model

14:34.960 --> 14:35.960
So what are those lines?

14:35.960 --> 14:37.960
Like at one point you have two lines

14:37.960 --> 14:38.960
Yeah

14:38.960 --> 14:40.960
So these are what are known as sub-bands

14:40.960 --> 14:41.960
Not very well defined here

14:41.960 --> 14:45.960
So that is why most people find this figure coming so soon

14:45.960 --> 14:47.960
The text local is a bit indigestible

14:47.960 --> 14:48.960
But I'm just telling you

14:48.960 --> 14:50.960
That there are two concepts here

14:50.960 --> 14:52.960
States and electrons

14:52.960 --> 14:54.960
At least we can agree on that

14:54.960 --> 14:59.960
States refers to an electron can exist here

14:59.960 --> 15:02.960
It doesn't mean that it will exist there

15:02.960 --> 15:04.960
It can exist here

15:04.960 --> 15:06.960
While on the other hand

15:06.960 --> 15:07.960
An electron is an electron

15:07.960 --> 15:09.960
It's either there or it's not there

15:09.960 --> 15:10.960
It's a binary choice

15:10.960 --> 15:16.960
So it's like the bonding electrons are there and electrons are there

15:16.960 --> 15:19.960
In the anti-bonding also electrons can be there

15:19.960 --> 15:23.960
But they're not usually there because they're anti-bonding orbitals to start with

15:23.960 --> 15:27.960
Like if I have a surplus of electrons then it will be there

15:27.960 --> 15:30.960
You'll have to be more clear about what you mean by surplus of electrons

15:30.960 --> 15:33.960
I mean like for silicon there are only 14 electrons

15:33.960 --> 15:35.960
So 4 electrons take place in this bonding-anti-bonding

15:35.960 --> 15:40.960
If I had say a different atom with say 18 electrons

15:40.960 --> 15:42.960
It'll also have a different band structure

15:42.960 --> 15:43.960
For the same

15:43.960 --> 15:46.960
If it had the same band structure then it would be okay

15:46.960 --> 15:48.960
But again then we're talking about a virtual material

15:48.960 --> 15:49.960
Yeah

15:49.960 --> 15:50.960
Okay

15:50.960 --> 15:52.960
So why is it always an integer multiple?

15:52.960 --> 15:54.960
Because we count electrons

15:54.960 --> 15:56.960
There's no such thing as 1.3 electrons

15:56.960 --> 15:59.960
So it's an integer multiple of the number of electrons

15:59.960 --> 16:04.960
I mean if you have zero electrons how can you have three minor states in the total state?

16:04.960 --> 16:10.960
See four n states means that there are that many places for electrons to go set

16:10.960 --> 16:14.960
But they're not sitting there at present

16:14.960 --> 16:19.960
Do these states have to be equal in the conduction band and valence band or are they different?

16:19.960 --> 16:21.960
They can be different, depends on your bandwidth

16:21.960 --> 16:26.960
It depends on how many bonding and what is the energy level difference between bonding and anti-bonding and etc.

16:26.960 --> 16:28.960
Again multiple depends completely

16:28.960 --> 16:32.960
But what is the use of this diagram if we cannot create such a diagram?

16:32.960 --> 16:39.960
The use of this diagram is for you to get an early flavour of that

16:39.960 --> 16:46.960
The concept of a state being available and the concept of an electron actually populating that state are two different ideas

16:46.960 --> 16:53.960
We will based on, you know, driven or motivated by this diagram calculate the number of states available

16:53.960 --> 16:57.960
And also the correspondence that is needed to populate those states

16:57.960 --> 17:01.960
The combination of the two will give us certain important quantities

17:01.960 --> 17:05.960
And that we want to possibly by next next lecture

17:05.960 --> 17:11.960
Sir but in this diagram the only part of the diagram that we ever will really work with is the

17:11.960 --> 17:15.960
The dashed line, the rest are all virtual materials

17:15.960 --> 17:22.960
The dashed line, the vertical dashed line, that is real silicon, the rest is all virtual silicon

17:22.960 --> 17:24.960
Right? Okay

17:24.960 --> 17:29.960
Sir how from the graph are we integrating this four n and three n at any specific point?

17:29.960 --> 17:30.960
Pardon?

17:30.960 --> 17:31.960
Yeah?

17:31.960 --> 17:34.960
Like if you take any point on this line, how are you integrating that?

17:34.960 --> 17:37.960
Okay there will be two n states, okay there will be four n states or something

17:37.960 --> 17:39.960
Because we are talking about fermions, right?

17:39.960 --> 17:41.960
Electrons up spin and down spin

17:41.960 --> 17:42.960
Yes

17:42.960 --> 17:43.960
So two states

17:43.960 --> 17:46.960
No I mean if you take any random point on this

17:46.960 --> 17:47.960
Yes

17:47.960 --> 17:49.960
Like there is no like order in this thing

17:49.960 --> 17:54.960
It would be like a state and then there will be something less than a state as you go along

17:54.960 --> 17:56.960
This is a continuum right?

17:56.960 --> 17:57.960
This is a continuum

17:57.960 --> 17:58.960
Yes

17:58.960 --> 18:00.960
So it could be anywhere in here right?

18:00.960 --> 18:05.960
No I mean you like they say it is four n states and then after that eight n states and then two n states

18:05.960 --> 18:08.960
So there is no order, so how are you pinpointing the number of

18:08.960 --> 18:10.960
Because that arises from silicon matter

18:11.960 --> 18:13.960
It is a result of a calculation, yes

18:13.960 --> 18:18.960
Sir also is there any concept of kind of on purpose pushing or pulling the silicon atoms

18:18.960 --> 18:20.960
In different distances for ideal value?

18:20.960 --> 18:24.960
Okay now you have raised an important question that you didn't mean to

18:24.960 --> 18:26.960
Strain silicon

18:26.960 --> 18:29.960
Like if I take silicon and I grow it on a substrate

18:29.960 --> 18:32.960
Which is lattice mismatched

18:32.960 --> 18:33.960
What will that do?

18:33.960 --> 18:35.960
Mismatched as an exfoliator

18:35.960 --> 18:38.960
Like it either has a lattice constant larger than five or smaller than five

18:38.960 --> 18:41.960
Compressive or tensile strain

18:41.960 --> 18:46.960
Which means that I will be constructing one of these virtual silicons there

18:46.960 --> 18:48.960
But at least within certain number of monolayers

18:48.960 --> 18:50.960
Because I know what happens when I go further away from the interface

18:50.960 --> 18:52.960
We already discussed it actually

18:52.960 --> 18:57.960
There it basically relaxes to bulk whether through formation dislocations or not

18:57.960 --> 18:58.960
Because

18:58.960 --> 19:01.960
Because silicon you cannot force a bulk

19:01.960 --> 19:05.960
Like a large piece of silicon into becoming virtual silicon of some sort

19:05.960 --> 19:08.960
It will only mean certain number of layers that is impacted by that

19:08.960 --> 19:09.960
Yes

19:09.960 --> 19:13.960
Sir in the previous diagram you actually

19:13.960 --> 19:15.960
You don't have to go back sir

19:15.960 --> 19:17.960
Like when we had bonding and anti-bonding

19:17.960 --> 19:20.960
There was a lower line for bonding electrons

19:20.960 --> 19:22.960
And the upper line

19:22.960 --> 19:26.960
So the two lines for the actual spacing that we have

19:26.960 --> 19:28.960
Where we have force n states

19:28.960 --> 19:30.960
And force n electrons

19:30.960 --> 19:32.960
Those are for the bonding ones

19:32.960 --> 19:33.960
Then there is the bandgap

19:33.960 --> 19:35.960
And then the upper two are for the anti-bonding ones

19:35.960 --> 19:37.960
Yeah so force n states and zero electrons

19:37.960 --> 19:38.960
Yeah

19:38.960 --> 19:42.960
Mind you force n states and zero electrons is something that would occur at absolute zero

19:42.960 --> 19:46.960
Where there is no energy available for the electrons to go up the production band

19:46.960 --> 19:50.960
You will discover that in like a couple of slides but I am just putting it out here

19:50.960 --> 19:54.960
In this graph here you can see what is a virtual silicon and what is a real silicon

19:54.960 --> 19:56.960
Dash line is the real silicon

19:56.960 --> 19:57.960
The vertical dash line

19:57.960 --> 19:58.960
That is it

19:58.960 --> 20:01.960
Because that is the lattice distance at which silicon condenses

20:01.960 --> 20:02.960
There is no other distance

20:02.960 --> 20:04.960
But there are three dash lines

20:04.960 --> 20:06.960
Oh they are just reference lines

20:06.960 --> 20:09.960
They were just showing okay that in that particular period there is no gap

20:09.960 --> 20:10.960
Pardon

20:10.960 --> 20:15.960
I think you are referring to this neck over here right

20:15.960 --> 20:16.960
Yeah

20:16.960 --> 20:19.960
So this is also a virtual silicon

20:19.960 --> 20:21.960
But importantly there is no bandgap

20:21.960 --> 20:25.960
So that is why it is indicated in that

20:25.960 --> 20:26.960
Sir is there

20:26.960 --> 20:28.960
What is the use for virtual silicon?

20:28.960 --> 20:29.960
I just mentioned

20:29.960 --> 20:30.960
You got a straight layer of silicon

20:30.960 --> 20:31.960
You will have to go

20:31.960 --> 20:32.960
That is how the moment created

20:32.960 --> 20:33.960
But are there like

20:33.960 --> 20:34.960
Oh yes

20:34.960 --> 20:37.960
The effective mass for instance is different for straight silicon

20:37.960 --> 20:39.960
You might need it for some application

20:39.960 --> 20:44.960
What about for a very small layer like say 10-20 layers of silicon

20:44.960 --> 20:47.960
Is it useful practically like can you build and you know

20:47.960 --> 20:54.960
I would say that almost all the modern devices basically they rely almost critically on those 10-20 layers

20:54.960 --> 20:55.960
The bulk does not matter

20:55.960 --> 20:59.960
Sir so the casual speed will be different in a screened or compressed silicon obviously

20:59.960 --> 21:01.960
They will have different mobilities different bandgap everything is different

21:01.960 --> 21:05.960
So which one actually has a faster speed is there like a general input or

21:05.960 --> 21:06.960
No

21:06.960 --> 21:15.960
So for instance it depends upon whether the scattering in that particular direction changes enough so as to go below the bulk silicon scattering or not

21:15.960 --> 21:19.960
Will depend upon the material how it is trained by how much it is trained

21:19.960 --> 21:24.960
And whether there are any dipole-dipole interactions because if the underlying material is polar

21:24.960 --> 21:27.960
It will have an influence it will lead to dipole scattering also

21:27.960 --> 21:31.960
So it is a complex question depends on each system

21:31.960 --> 21:35.960
Sir so we can does that actually math exist like is it

21:35.960 --> 21:37.960
Math is very hard

21:37.960 --> 21:42.960
See this is a case of where math is extremely hard but experiments are relatively easy

21:42.960 --> 21:45.960
And importantly they get you the result you want

21:45.960 --> 21:47.960
So yeah

21:47.960 --> 21:52.960
Sir so maybe we can come up with a theory to explain this

21:52.960 --> 21:53.960
It depends

21:53.960 --> 21:58.960
So how are these states defined there and I am not looking at that what is that important state

21:58.960 --> 22:00.960
But if I didn't show it to you you will understand exactly

22:00.960 --> 22:08.960
Sir why are in the left and the right half symmetric like there are two atoms that go in the middle

22:08.960 --> 22:13.960
Yeah

22:13.960 --> 22:16.960
So it is asymmetric because this is asymmetric

22:16.960 --> 22:19.960
But that would be same

22:19.960 --> 22:21.960
You never know

22:21.960 --> 22:23.960
Look this is the offshore distance

22:23.960 --> 22:28.960
So it is a measure of how close the two atoms get and how far away they go

22:28.960 --> 22:30.960
It is not whether I am making the lecture right

22:30.960 --> 22:32.960
I hope that is clear

22:32.960 --> 22:36.960
I am saying I have got an aggregator number of atoms

22:36.960 --> 22:38.960
Which come and condense at a distance r

22:38.960 --> 22:39.960
You never know

22:39.960 --> 22:41.960
Tell me what happens at a distance r

22:41.960 --> 22:43.960
That is what this diagram is

22:43.960 --> 22:44.960
I don't know

22:44.960 --> 22:45.960
I don't know

22:45.960 --> 22:46.960
I don't know

22:46.960 --> 22:47.960
I don't know

22:47.960 --> 22:48.960
I don't know

22:48.960 --> 22:49.960
I don't know

22:49.960 --> 22:51.960
I don't know

22:51.960 --> 22:56.960
This is the continuous

22:56.960 --> 22:59.000
I think this is the urgent

22:59.000 --> 23:00.960
This is the region

23:00.960 --> 23:01.960
Right

23:01.960 --> 23:14.600
N refers to the number of atoms that is

23:14.600 --> 23:17.960
Nobody asked me that question

23:17.960 --> 23:19.960
Well that comes

23:19.960 --> 23:20.960
. . . . . 다

23:20.960 --> 23:21.900
These back lines?

23:22.100 --> 23:22.440
These ones?

23:23.100 --> 23:24.880
So this is just a distance at which

23:24.880 --> 23:26.320
virtual silicon does not have a band.

23:28.680 --> 23:31.020
The property of the material at that particular distance.

23:31.160 --> 23:32.980
It is just that if I left things B,

23:33.300 --> 23:34.760
it would never condense into this form.

23:35.780 --> 23:37.020
But you could say

23:37.020 --> 23:38.720
that by going by the definition of metal

23:38.720 --> 23:41.720
that a silicon that condenses it

23:41.720 --> 23:43.000
with this interatomic distance

23:43.000 --> 23:43.740
would act as a metal.

23:45.120 --> 23:45.600
Is this enough?

23:47.100 --> 23:48.160
So what was N here?

23:48.160 --> 23:51.600
Well, there is no gap.

23:52.540 --> 23:53.600
It depends upon

23:53.600 --> 23:56.060
at what energy you are injecting carriers into it.

23:56.080 --> 23:58.040
If the energy is much below

23:58.040 --> 23:59.760
this level,

24:00.240 --> 24:01.200
then it will be insulated.

24:01.340 --> 24:02.820
If I am injecting anywhere above this,

24:02.820 --> 24:03.500
then that doesn't matter.

24:04.820 --> 24:06.220
But why doesn't silicon exist

24:06.220 --> 24:07.640
in that virtual region,

24:07.720 --> 24:09.660
but it exists after that virtual region?

24:10.680 --> 24:11.340
No, no.

24:11.460 --> 24:13.660
Silicon exists only at this line.

24:14.340 --> 24:14.860
Nowhere else.

24:16.380 --> 24:17.740
Everything else is virtual here.

24:17.980 --> 24:18.120
Okay.

24:18.160 --> 24:21.980
So can I construct silicon

24:21.980 --> 24:23.900
that is an iron

24:23.900 --> 24:24.680
and a fiber?

24:26.140 --> 24:26.540
See,

24:27.540 --> 24:28.080
first of all,

24:28.220 --> 24:30.000
the further away I go from this black line,

24:30.080 --> 24:31.420
the harder it becomes to construct that.

24:31.680 --> 24:31.820
Right?

24:32.080 --> 24:33.060
Everybody will give me that?

24:33.820 --> 24:35.600
So even if I do strained air epitaxy,

24:35.640 --> 24:36.860
I am not going to go very far away

24:36.860 --> 24:37.580
from that black line.

24:38.660 --> 24:40.740
So whether you can reach that neck region

24:40.740 --> 24:42.020
using strained air epitaxy,

24:42.820 --> 24:44.340
so far there are no reports.

24:45.980 --> 24:47.980
So what was the capital of the drop?

24:47.980 --> 24:48.280
Yeah.

24:48.280 --> 24:50.680
What was the number of?

24:50.680 --> 24:51.680
I don't understand.

24:51.680 --> 24:52.680
.

24:52.680 --> 24:53.680
.

24:53.680 --> 24:54.680
.

24:54.680 --> 24:55.680
.

24:55.680 --> 24:56.680
.

24:56.680 --> 24:57.680
.

24:57.680 --> 24:58.680
.

24:58.680 --> 24:59.680
.

24:59.680 --> 25:00.680
.

25:00.680 --> 25:01.680
.

25:01.680 --> 25:02.680
.

25:02.680 --> 25:03.680
.

25:03.680 --> 25:04.680
.

25:04.680 --> 25:05.680
.

25:05.680 --> 25:06.680
.

25:06.680 --> 25:07.680
.

25:07.680 --> 25:08.680
.

25:08.680 --> 25:09.680
.

25:09.680 --> 25:10.680
.

25:10.680 --> 25:11.680
.

25:11.680 --> 25:12.680
.

25:12.680 --> 25:13.680
.

25:13.680 --> 25:14.680
.

25:14.680 --> 25:15.680
.

25:15.680 --> 25:16.680
.

25:16.680 --> 25:17.680
.

25:17.680 --> 25:17.720
.

25:17.720 --> 25:18.380
.

25:18.380 --> 25:25.420
So another thing,

25:25.700 --> 25:27.940
because of the Williams band being

25:27.940 --> 25:29.740
a collection of

25:29.740 --> 25:31.700
random orbitals

25:31.700 --> 25:34.780
and the conduction band being a collection of

25:34.780 --> 25:35.960
anti-warning orbitals,

25:37.680 --> 25:38.660
at the dashed line,

25:38.880 --> 25:39.480
real silicon,

25:41.140 --> 25:43.740
six n states are in the 3T orbitals.

25:45.340 --> 25:46.760
We can do that.

25:46.760 --> 25:50.100
and 3s has 2n states

25:50.100 --> 25:51.540
because s orbital carries only 2

25:51.540 --> 25:54.520
so there is an asymmetry

25:54.520 --> 25:55.600
in the number of states available

25:55.600 --> 25:56.760
between valence and conduction

25:56.760 --> 26:00.720
in general

26:00.720 --> 26:03.800
that asymmetry will not show itself

26:03.800 --> 26:04.240
because

26:04.240 --> 26:07.620
as we will learn later when we change the x coordinate

26:07.620 --> 26:08.280
of this plot

26:08.280 --> 26:11.380
the energies that are needed to

26:11.380 --> 26:14.000
run into a case where these 2n or 6n

26:14.000 --> 26:14.720
are insufficient

26:14.720 --> 26:17.620
in general it won't arise

26:17.620 --> 26:19.260
the energies needed are just

26:19.260 --> 26:21.860
your silicon crystal will disintegrate

26:21.860 --> 26:22.640
before you get to 2n

26:22.640 --> 26:25.560
so let's say

26:25.560 --> 26:27.040
I start populating these states

26:27.040 --> 26:29.780
how much energy do I need

26:29.780 --> 26:31.440
to actually fill them all up

26:31.440 --> 26:34.020
more than the band gap

26:34.020 --> 26:36.060
because you see these states are in a continuum

26:36.060 --> 26:38.000
which means you need the band gap

26:38.000 --> 26:39.380
energy to reach the band edge

26:39.380 --> 26:41.300
I need more energy to go above that

26:41.300 --> 26:43.760
and that keeps on rising

26:43.760 --> 26:46.000
you will have the exact mathematical formula

26:46.000 --> 26:46.660
for that in a bit

26:46.660 --> 26:51.560
so counting of occupied and unoccupied states

26:51.560 --> 26:51.960
we have done

26:51.960 --> 26:53.500
so now let's define some basics

26:53.500 --> 26:55.580
of what you have learnt regarding band structure

26:55.580 --> 26:58.000
now here is where x coordinates

26:58.000 --> 26:59.680
of that plot become important

26:59.680 --> 27:00.480
I am going to draw

27:00.480 --> 27:02.180
2 different

27:02.180 --> 27:05.020
pictures here

27:05.020 --> 27:13.340
energy

27:13.760 --> 27:19.160
so the previous graph was also in the transformed space

27:19.160 --> 27:22.260
or that was in the non-real space

27:22.260 --> 27:23.460
no that was in real space

27:23.460 --> 27:24.380
I was in real space

27:24.380 --> 27:26.640
this is now in transformed space

27:26.640 --> 27:28.980
I am going to that

27:28.980 --> 27:34.220
so you see E versus R

27:34.220 --> 27:35.920
there is another way of actually plotting this

27:35.920 --> 27:37.140
that is in dual space

27:37.140 --> 27:38.300
E versus A

27:38.300 --> 27:42.420
now this is where x coordinates become dual space

27:42.420 --> 27:43.740
what question is this plot

27:43.760 --> 27:45.760
what information does this plot give you

27:45.760 --> 27:47.760
what is the energy of my electron

27:47.760 --> 27:50.760
versus the separation between the two atoms

27:50.760 --> 27:52.760
versus the separation between the two atoms

27:52.760 --> 27:55.760
or if I have already got a grain of silicon

27:55.760 --> 27:56.760
I have an electron

27:56.760 --> 28:00.760
I want to track its energy as it pops from atom to atom

28:00.760 --> 28:01.760
right

28:01.760 --> 28:05.760
but the thing is the electron is moving in real space

28:05.760 --> 28:06.760
here

28:06.760 --> 28:10.760
so this is known as

28:10.760 --> 28:13.260
band diagram

28:13.260 --> 28:16.260
it's important to get these terminologies right

28:16.260 --> 28:19.260
that's what a band diagram is

28:19.260 --> 28:21.260
this one is in dual space now

28:21.260 --> 28:23.260
E versus K

28:23.260 --> 28:24.260
this still

28:24.260 --> 28:27.260
if I ask myself the same question

28:27.260 --> 28:30.260
the information I would get from this particular

28:30.260 --> 28:31.260
you know

28:31.260 --> 28:34.260
plot would be

28:34.260 --> 28:37.260
how much energy does my electron have

28:37.260 --> 28:40.260
depending on how fast it is moving

28:40.260 --> 28:42.260
so what is the energy of the electron?

28:42.260 --> 28:43.260
not always

28:43.260 --> 28:44.260
not always

28:44.260 --> 28:45.260
not always

28:45.260 --> 28:47.260
I'll show you in a moment

28:47.260 --> 28:50.260
this plot assumes that the band

28:50.260 --> 28:52.260
I should put a name over here

28:52.260 --> 28:54.260
this particular plot is known as

28:54.260 --> 28:55.260
band structure

28:55.260 --> 28:56.260
band structure

29:02.260 --> 29:05.260
so band diagram and band structure have two different means

29:05.260 --> 29:10.260
only if I'm very very close to the minimum of the conduction band

29:10.260 --> 29:11.260
and I'll define that in a moment

29:11.260 --> 29:17.260
the further away I go that's no longer true

29:17.260 --> 29:18.260
okay

29:18.260 --> 29:21.260
now let's talk about a direct band gap semiconductor

29:21.260 --> 29:22.260
okay

29:22.260 --> 29:32.260
so it is traditional to locate the top of the valence band at equal to zero

29:32.260 --> 29:34.260
okay

29:34.260 --> 29:38.260
and we always draw this as well as this

29:38.260 --> 29:40.260
for increasing electron energies

29:40.260 --> 29:41.260
okay

29:41.260 --> 29:42.260
this is a convention

29:42.260 --> 29:43.260
this is a convention

29:43.260 --> 29:44.260
you can do it in any other way

29:44.260 --> 29:46.260
by the way it will be perfectly correct

29:46.260 --> 29:50.260
but you will have to add negative signs throughout your entire semiconductor

29:50.260 --> 29:51.260
everywhere

29:51.260 --> 29:53.260
see it's like a voltage right?

29:53.260 --> 29:55.260
if you multiply this with charge

29:55.260 --> 29:58.260
I actually get something that has the dimensions of a voltage
