#### **Energy Convention in Semiconductors**

The professor begins by discussing the convention used for representing the energy of electrons in semiconductors. They explain that while the electron charge is negative, in semiconductors, we often follow a convention where energy is represented as \( E \times E \). This is because focusing on the negative sign can complicate matters. Instead, by using the \( E \times E \) convention, it simplifies discussions and calculations. The professor emphasizes that this convention is universal in semiconductors, and almost no scientific literature deviates from it.

The conduction band is typically drawn at the bottom because we associate higher energies with anti-bonding orbitals, a concept just learned in the course. The convention aligns with the idea that promoting electrons to higher energy levels corresponds to the system being in a higher energy state. This is not a special rule but rather a universally accepted protocol.

#### **Band Diagram and Bulk Silicon**

The professor shifts to discussing how the valence band is typically located at \( E = 0 \). When drawing the band diagram for real silicon, they note that the valence band energy remains constant as a function of \( R \) (position of the electron relative to the atoms). This constancy is because the material is homogeneous; the band gap doesn't change within the bulk of the material.

The professor explains that in a continuous space with atoms A and B, even if their relative distance changes, the distance dictated by nature remains fixed, ensuring that the band gap is constant. Therefore, in the bulk of the material, the highest energy at which an electron remains in the valence band and the lowest energy at which it can move freely (in the conduction band) are the same regardless of the electron's position in the bulk. The band diagram in this context is simple—just two parallel lines representing the conduction band (EC) and the valence band (EV).

However, the simplicity of this diagram only applies to the bulk. In actual devices, which include interfaces with other materials (like contacts), discontinuities in the band diagram occur, and the position of the electron relative to these interfaces becomes significant.

#### **Crystal Momentum (K) and Band Structure**

The professor introduces the concept of crystal momentum (\( K \)) and its significance. They note that the band diagram discussed earlier does not require defining \( R \) because energy is constant in the bulk. However, \( K \) is different and crucial for understanding band structures, especially near the edges of the conduction band.

The professor draws the conduction band, explaining that in real materials like silicon, the energy increases as we move away from the edge of the conduction band. This is because higher energy corresponds to higher momentum, and the electrons in the conduction band are less bound compared to those in the valence band.

#### **Direct vs. Indirect Bandgap Semiconductors**

This leads to a critical discussion on direct and indirect bandgap semiconductors. The professor states that if the bottom of the conduction band and the top of the valence band are at the same \( K \) coordinate (often \( K = 0 \)), the semiconductor is considered a direct bandgap semiconductor. In a direct bandgap material, an electron can transition directly between the conduction and valence bands, making these materials suitable for light-emitting devices like LEDs.

However, in silicon, the bottom of the conduction band is not aligned with the top of the valence band in \( K \)-space. This misalignment makes silicon an indirect bandgap semiconductor. For silicon, the bottom of the conduction band occurs at around 0.85 of the first Brillouin zone (FBZ) in \( K \)-space, not at \( K = 0 \). This misalignment complicates electron transitions, requiring additional particles (phonons) to conserve momentum.

#### **Photon Emission and LED Efficiency**

The professor ties this into a practical example: how LEDs work. In direct bandgap semiconductors, an injected electron and hole can recombine directly, emitting a photon. However, in an indirect bandgap material like silicon, the electron at the bottom of the conduction band has a different momentum from the hole at the top of the valence band. This difference requires a phonon to balance the momentum, making the process inefficient for light emission.

The momentum of a photon is negligible compared to the momentum of electrons in silicon, meaning direct recombination without phonons isn't possible. This inefficiency is why silicon is not suitable for LEDs and why other materials like gallium arsenide are used instead.

#### **Importance of the First Brillouin Zone and K-Space**

The professor further elaborates on the importance of the first Brillouin zone (FBZ) in \( K \)-space. The FBZ represents the fundamental periodicity of the crystal lattice, and any band structure outside this zone repeats itself. Within this zone, as we move away from the center, the momentum increases.

This momentum increase is crucial because, in a bound electron state, there is an energy barrier to overcome to escape that state. This requires higher momentum, analogous to a satellite needing more energy to escape a planet's gravity. The first Brillouin zone thus helps define the energy levels and momentum in the crystal.

#### **Complexity of Silicon's Band Structure**

Returning to silicon, the professor notes that the complexity of its band structure stems from its indirect bandgap. The misalignment of the conduction and valence bands in \( K \)-space means that electron transitions are less straightforward, requiring additional energy and particles (phonons) to facilitate transitions.

In an indirect bandgap semiconductor like silicon, recombination of an electron from the conduction band and a hole from the valence band requires overcoming this momentum difference. The energy required for such transitions typically results in inefficiency, particularly in light emission applications.

---

#### **Conclusion and Final Thoughts**

The lecture concludes with a practical consideration: silicon’s inefficiency in light emission due to its indirect bandgap. This discussion highlights why alternative materials like gallium arsenide are preferred for applications requiring efficient light emission, such as LEDs. The lecture also sets the stage for future discussions on phonons, momentum conservation, and their implications in semiconductor devices.
