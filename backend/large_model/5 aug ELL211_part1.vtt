00:00.000 --> 00:08.620
Okay. So packaging and the fact that it

00:08.620 --> 00:16.760
is the highest value in some sense,

00:16.760 --> 00:22.720
what we are teaching in this class is

00:22.720 --> 00:24.600
only what I would call

00:24.600 --> 00:27.980
20 percent of the overall amount of materials.

00:27.980 --> 00:31.220
This is not to say that this is just

00:31.220 --> 00:37.140
some pre-designed bug that we just use as a standard package.

00:37.960 --> 00:43.420
Packaging is used to be considered like an art in itself,

00:43.420 --> 00:47.980
but now increasingly because of the heat issues,

00:47.980 --> 00:50.260
people no longer speak about

00:50.260 --> 00:52.780
integrated software in the package separately.

00:52.780 --> 00:56.360
Instead, they talk about packaging of systems.

00:56.480 --> 00:57.980
That means that

00:57.980 --> 01:04.380
heat core design or thermal core design has to be a part of the IC design process itself.

01:04.380 --> 01:07.300
Unfortunately, as far as I know,

01:07.300 --> 01:11.340
only one course in any of the IITs in India,

01:11.340 --> 01:15.960
IIT Bombay, actually teaches IC design in that way.

01:15.960 --> 01:19.500
Even our VLSI design program over here,

01:19.500 --> 01:22.840
talks about IC design in isolation more or less.

01:22.840 --> 01:25.960
It doesn't make all the grammars. Can I help you?

01:25.960 --> 01:26.960
Yes, please.

01:26.960 --> 01:27.960
Okay.

01:27.980 --> 01:31.260
See, if you can send all the stuff together at one point,

01:31.260 --> 01:32.060
I'll be able to help you.

01:32.060 --> 01:34.440
But if you keep coming every five minutes to interrupt me,

01:34.440 --> 01:35.440
that's not really the problem.

01:35.440 --> 01:37.540
Please, please, please don't.

01:38.560 --> 01:46.540
So, the issue is that this kind of

01:46.540 --> 01:49.480
fragmented knowledge forces people to take

01:49.480 --> 01:53.460
electives in domains that they don't consider their own.

01:53.460 --> 01:56.860
For instance, mechanical engineering has a big input here because heat transfer is

01:56.860 --> 01:57.940
a central part of

01:57.980 --> 01:59.220
that study.

01:59.220 --> 02:05.520
As a part of the ISN-India's Immigration Commission,

02:05.520 --> 02:08.340
the most publicly publicized part of this is

02:08.340 --> 02:11.100
for me and I, could probably participate in initiative.

02:11.100 --> 02:15.880
Which can also be a part of .

02:15.880 --> 02:22.880
So, one of the lift well know concepts,

02:22.880 --> 02:24.980
they have a lot of people going there.

02:24.980 --> 02:26.040
I will try to figure out something out for you.

02:26.040 --> 02:26.660
They remain at least one guysbelen beras in compliance with theceeding.

02:26.660 --> 02:26.920
I would like to ask you that question recordings there.

02:26.920 --> 02:26.980
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. No problem.

02:26.980 --> 02:27.040
Okay. Thank you.

02:27.040 --> 02:27.060
Yes.

02:27.080 --> 02:27.220
Yes PuwaÅ‚...

02:27.220 --> 02:27.240
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes followed by the Infrastructure Again.

02:27.240 --> 02:27.620
Okay. Yes. Yes. Yes. Uh...black background and one of the rest publications

02:27.620 --> 02:27.780
who is actually going there too?

02:27.780 --> 02:37.780
I know parts of activism are even in the whole education system when it comes to this part of technology research and development.

02:37.780 --> 02:46.780
And there, certain new VTech or MTech programs are going to be offered in a few years,

02:46.780 --> 02:51.780
which are entirely geared about taking elements of various traditional practices of engineering

02:51.780 --> 02:57.780
and offering them as, you know, semiconductor devices or something like that.

02:57.780 --> 03:04.780
So this packaging issue is not just something that you can learn later on your own.

03:04.780 --> 03:10.780
I recommend that if you are interested in going into this field, start looking for corresponding electives,

03:10.780 --> 03:15.780
because you will not have the time to learn heat transfer from scratch after you've completed your VTech,

03:15.780 --> 03:20.780
or you're late into your MTech, etc. It's just one of the matters.

03:20.780 --> 03:21.780
Then we shall come back to this.

03:21.780 --> 03:24.780
We'll start it, resume our discussion.

03:24.780 --> 03:26.780
This part was prompted by a student question.

03:26.780 --> 03:34.780
But then we resume our discussion on what happens to carrier wave functions in various kinds of materials,

03:34.780 --> 03:39.780
starting from the understanding that only in a perfectly periodic crystal do you have black-hot scattering.

03:39.780 --> 03:43.780
In any room temperature case, you will not have a perfect crystal.

03:43.780 --> 03:50.780
You will have vibrations, which give rise to virtual particles known as phonons.

03:50.780 --> 03:56.780
In a second quantization sense, interact with carriers, and that leads to scattering.

03:56.780 --> 04:06.780
We defined an R-space, which is easy enough to understand, in one dimension, two dimensions, and three dimensions.

04:06.780 --> 04:12.780
But there is a dual space to that, which arises from Fourier transforms, which is also periodic.

04:12.780 --> 04:19.780
And if you are starting in the Bravais lattice, one of those 14 lattices,

04:19.780 --> 04:24.780
then its dual space is known as a reciprocal lattice.

04:24.780 --> 04:28.780
And the reciprocal lattice is guaranteed to be also a Bravais lattice.

04:28.780 --> 04:34.780
Of course, there is no guarantee that Bravais lattice A maps into reciprocal lattice A.

04:34.780 --> 04:42.780
It could be B, where B is also a set of initial Bravais lattices that we started with.

04:42.780 --> 04:44.780
Then we had a simple class problem.

04:44.780 --> 04:48.780
We defined planes, classes of planes.

04:48.780 --> 04:53.780
We defined families of planes which are parallel to each other, or depending upon the nature of symmetry.

04:53.780 --> 04:57.780
They may even be orthogonal, but they have the same symmetry in that direction.

04:57.780 --> 05:05.780
The practical influence of understanding of planes is that it allows you to

05:05.780 --> 05:11.780
please wafers without actually shattering them and losing a lot of material,

05:11.780 --> 05:17.780
and also causing edge issues, because you want to use the entire real estate as much as possible.

05:17.780 --> 05:20.780
We defined waferents in real space, corresponding to that,

05:20.780 --> 05:25.780
because of the relationship between the periodicity r and the periodicity k,

05:25.780 --> 05:32.780
is that if ikr, essentially, is equal to a constant, or 1, depending on your normalization,

05:32.780 --> 05:35.780
is also a waferent.

05:35.780 --> 05:37.780
So if r is a waferent, k is also a waferent.

05:37.780 --> 05:40.780
That's the property of plane waves.

05:40.780 --> 05:46.780
Then we formally defined the reciprocal lattice, and we expanded on the Fourier part.

05:47.780 --> 05:51.780
Let's today connect this more to crystallography.

05:51.780 --> 05:55.780
You've all seen Miller's analysis? Have you?

05:55.780 --> 05:57.780
No.

05:57.780 --> 06:03.780
So those of you who did coordinate geometry, and I think it was all of you in 11th grade,

06:03.780 --> 06:07.780
you know how to write down the equation of a plane, right?

06:07.780 --> 06:13.780
One of the canonical forms of the equation of a plane is a dot n equal to a constant, right?

06:13.780 --> 06:16.780
Which is also the biggest discussion.

06:17.780 --> 06:23.780
So, Miller indices, in that sense, are an exercise in finding the normal to the plane.

06:23.780 --> 06:27.780
As long as you can write the normal to the plane, which is the equation of the plane effectively,

06:27.780 --> 06:30.780
you can figure out where the indices are.

06:30.780 --> 06:37.780
So, the area vector for a plane is picked to be parallel to the shortest reciprocal lattice vector.

06:37.780 --> 06:45.780
So notice that, in coordinate geometry, the direction that is perpendicular to the plane is also in r3.

06:45.780 --> 06:46.780
Right?

06:46.780 --> 06:50.780
So, if you're starting with a plane arbitrarily oriented in r3,

06:50.780 --> 06:53.780
then the vector that is perpendicular is also in r3.

06:53.780 --> 06:56.780
But here we're making a departure from that.

06:56.780 --> 07:01.780
We're saying that if you have a plane in real space,

07:01.780 --> 07:09.780
then its vertical is a point in reciprocal space which has a k-position vector.

07:09.780 --> 07:12.780
It's just a change of terminology. That is all there.

07:12.780 --> 07:14.780
Let me repeat.

07:14.780 --> 07:18.780
If you have a plane which is arbitrarily oriented in r3,

07:18.780 --> 07:20.780
I find it's normal.

07:20.780 --> 07:24.780
The coordinates, which is basically a triplet,

07:24.780 --> 07:29.780
is a point in k-space.

07:29.780 --> 07:30.780
Same coordinates.

07:30.780 --> 07:32.780
So, let's say 3, 1, 5.

07:32.780 --> 07:37.780
Those are coordinates in k-space for the dual vector.

07:37.780 --> 07:40.780
So, if you have a plane in this direction, it maps to a point.

07:40.780 --> 07:42.780
A position vector, to be more precise.

07:42.780 --> 07:43.780
Yes?

07:43.780 --> 07:47.780
You're taking the normal to that plane and then mapping it to a point in k-space.

07:47.780 --> 07:50.780
You're just taking those coordinates and we will describe,

07:50.780 --> 07:53.780
because obviously people who work in crystallography

07:53.780 --> 07:56.780
are not very comfortable with working on Fourier analysis.

07:56.780 --> 07:58.780
So, they have their own way of arriving at the same thing,

07:58.780 --> 08:01.780
which I'll describe how to construct a Miller index.

08:01.780 --> 08:03.780
It is essentially the same process.

08:03.780 --> 08:05.780
If you have done a little bit of linear algebra,

08:05.780 --> 08:07.780
which I believe you have done,

08:07.780 --> 08:08.780
you can work out the steps and you'll say,

08:08.780 --> 08:10.780
okay, yeah, these two treatments are exactly equivalent.

08:10.780 --> 08:11.780
Sir, but for a plane like,

08:11.780 --> 08:13.780
we can't only depend on one model vector.

08:13.780 --> 08:14.780
We should also have a point, right?

08:14.780 --> 08:16.780
So, we will have to consider that when doing this.

08:16.780 --> 08:17.780
Which point?

08:17.780 --> 08:19.780
Meaning, if you have a normal vector,

08:19.780 --> 08:21.780
infinite planes which have a normal vector.

08:21.780 --> 08:22.780
Yeah.

08:22.780 --> 08:24.780
So, all you say is that if I define its normal vector,

08:24.780 --> 08:27.780
any normal which is a scalar multiple of that normal vector

08:27.780 --> 08:29.780
will also serve as a normal vector.

08:29.780 --> 08:31.780
What we're trying to find over here is the minimum normal vector.

08:31.780 --> 08:33.780
But I'm telling you that if there are infinite planes

08:33.780 --> 08:34.780
for the same normal vector, right?

08:34.780 --> 08:35.780
Yes, yes, yes.

08:35.780 --> 08:39.780
So, this basically goes back to our previous discussion,

08:39.780 --> 08:43.780
where families of planes corresponded to a single point in k-space.

08:43.780 --> 08:44.780
Okay.

08:44.780 --> 08:46.780
So, how do you construct a family of planes

08:46.780 --> 08:48.780
that are all parallel to each other?

08:48.780 --> 08:51.780
So, that discussion is exactly equivalent.

08:51.780 --> 08:54.780
So, you pick a parallel,

08:54.780 --> 08:57.780
but you pick the shortest reciprocal lattice vector

08:57.780 --> 09:02.780
and let us express that in three unit coordinates,

09:02.780 --> 09:04.780
or rather three unit vectors,

09:04.780 --> 09:06.780
in the linear space defined by b1, b2, b3,

09:06.780 --> 09:08.780
which I have bolded there.

09:08.780 --> 09:10.780
How do you construct it?

09:10.780 --> 09:12.780
It is the smallest integral coefficient

09:12.780 --> 09:17.780
in reciprocal space.

09:17.780 --> 09:21.780
So, you basically write it as,

09:21.780 --> 09:25.780
so if you have like this coordinate system in,

09:25.780 --> 09:27.780
I think, red or black?

09:27.780 --> 09:28.780
Yeah, black.

09:28.780 --> 09:30.780
It is in real space.

09:30.780 --> 09:33.780
Then you construct a coordinate system in red.

09:33.780 --> 09:37.780
That is the corresponding coordinate system in k-space.

09:37.780 --> 09:40.780
So, they are not, so black is r3,

09:40.780 --> 09:42.780
red is k3.

09:42.780 --> 09:45.780
And we are finding out

09:45.780 --> 09:49.780
the corresponding minimum intercepts

09:49.780 --> 09:54.780
a by h, b by k and c by l.

09:54.780 --> 09:56.780
And we are trying to find out h, k and l,

09:56.780 --> 09:58.780
which are the smallest integers

09:58.780 --> 10:00.780
which will make this possible.

10:00.780 --> 10:03.780
So, for instance, you have got 7 by 11 or something.

10:03.780 --> 10:07.780
Then 11 is the corresponding, you know,

10:07.780 --> 10:09.780
coordinate I have to worry about.

10:09.780 --> 10:11.780
Can you repeat it?

10:11.780 --> 10:15.780
So, what we are trying to do over here is,

10:15.780 --> 10:18.780
we are trying to find out coordinates in b-space,

10:18.780 --> 10:20.780
which is, you know, effectively mapping of k-space,

10:20.780 --> 10:22.780
h, k, l,

10:22.780 --> 10:25.780
so that you have b by,

10:25.780 --> 10:28.780
you are finding h, k and l,

10:28.780 --> 10:31.780
so that they are the smallest possible integer multiples

10:31.780 --> 10:32.780
in each direction.

10:32.780 --> 10:33.780
Yeah?

10:33.780 --> 10:35.780
The numbers you said.

10:35.780 --> 10:36.780
Yeah?

10:36.780 --> 10:39.780
The numbers you said, 7, 5, 11, I didn't get.

10:39.780 --> 10:40.780
So, we will give you a worked example.

10:40.780 --> 10:47.780
You will probably understand from that more clearly.

10:47.780 --> 10:50.780
So, crystallographic definition,

10:50.780 --> 10:52.780
which is independent of, you know,

10:52.780 --> 10:54.780
Fourier definition is that

10:54.780 --> 10:57.780
it is the inverse proportionality of intercepts in real space.

10:57.780 --> 10:59.780
So, for instance,

10:59.780 --> 11:01.780
if I have an arbitrarily oriented plane,

11:01.780 --> 11:03.780
which has intercepts,

11:03.780 --> 11:06.780
let's say x1, x2, x3,

11:06.780 --> 11:08.780
then the corresponding 1 over x1,

11:08.780 --> 11:09.780
1 over x2,

11:09.780 --> 11:10.780
1 over x3,

11:10.780 --> 11:12.780
expressed in smallest integer form,

11:12.780 --> 11:16.780
will be the corresponding h, k, l's.

11:16.780 --> 11:18.780
I take the inverse,

11:18.780 --> 11:21.780
and I find out the l, c, m, in some sense,

11:21.780 --> 11:22.780
for those,

11:22.780 --> 11:24.780
and those are h, k, l's,

11:24.780 --> 11:27.780
with no bound factors.

11:27.780 --> 11:31.780
So, for hexagonal and robohedral lattices,

11:31.780 --> 11:33.780
it is more convenient to use four indices,

11:33.780 --> 11:36.780
even though we are not talking about a four-dimensional space,

11:36.780 --> 11:38.780
because there is an additional axis,

11:38.780 --> 11:40.780
which is a c-axis in the road direction,

11:40.780 --> 11:42.780
you would present that using the fourth index.

11:42.780 --> 11:45.780
This is just specific to these two crystal structures.

11:45.780 --> 11:46.780
It is not necessary,

11:46.780 --> 11:48.780
it is entirely possible to express it in three,

11:48.780 --> 11:49.780
because it's after all,

11:49.780 --> 11:51.780
after a k3, you don't need more than that,

11:51.780 --> 11:54.780
but you can have an over-determined plane,

11:54.780 --> 11:55.780
for instance.

11:55.780 --> 11:56.780
It is equivalent to saying that,

11:56.780 --> 11:58.780
okay, I've got three non-polar points,

11:58.780 --> 12:00.780
and they define my plane,

12:00.780 --> 12:02.780
and I just happen to pick another fourth point

12:02.780 --> 12:04.780
on the same plane to define my plane.

12:04.780 --> 12:07.780
Makes no difference, really speaking.

12:07.780 --> 12:09.780
So, why do we do that?

12:09.780 --> 12:12.780
It's easier to express it,

12:12.780 --> 12:16.780
because there are, you know, additional axes here.

12:16.780 --> 12:17.780
So, let's do a class problem,

12:17.780 --> 12:20.780
and that will hopefully clear up some of these doubts.

12:20.780 --> 12:22.780
So, here is the problem.

12:22.780 --> 12:24.780
This plane in red, light red,

12:24.780 --> 12:27.780
I hope everybody can see that.

12:27.780 --> 12:29.780
It has these points defined,

12:29.780 --> 12:31.780
a and b,

12:31.780 --> 12:32.780
and the Miller indices,

12:32.780 --> 12:34.780
for this indicated plane.

12:37.780 --> 12:41.780
All right, so how many of these,

12:41.780 --> 12:42.780
what you heard is just one point.

12:42.780 --> 12:45.780
You'll remember again and again from our Himalayan class,

12:45.780 --> 12:47.780
were also an episode three.

12:47.780 --> 12:49.780
Sir, did I also drink another body of water?

12:49.780 --> 12:50.780
Yeah.

12:50.780 --> 12:53.780
That's obvious, right?

12:53.780 --> 12:59.780
Because Z cure is 0 in both cases.

13:07.780 --> 13:37.760
Thank you.

13:37.780 --> 14:07.760
Thank you.

14:07.780 --> 14:37.760
Thank you.

14:37.780 --> 15:07.760
Thank you.

15:07.780 --> 15:37.760
Thank you.

15:37.780 --> 16:07.760
Thank you.

16:07.780 --> 16:37.760
Thank you.

16:37.780 --> 17:07.760
Thank you.

17:07.780 --> 17:37.760
Thank you.

17:37.780 --> 18:07.760
Thank you.

18:07.780 --> 18:37.760
Thank you.

18:37.780 --> 19:07.760
Thank you.

19:07.780 --> 19:37.760
Thank you.

19:37.780 --> 19:41.720
of irrational points, like it could occur.

19:41.720 --> 19:43.280
Of course, we have got non-periodic systems

19:43.280 --> 19:44.880
like polycrystalline and morpher systems,

19:44.880 --> 19:46.280
they're not periodic either.

19:47.280 --> 19:52.280
Those are non-irrational examples of non-periodic systems.

19:52.280 --> 19:54.880
So for the non-periodic system,

19:54.880 --> 19:57.780
we cannot define the Fourier transform

19:57.780 --> 19:59.820
or there are no .

19:59.820 --> 20:01.980
Well, how would you calculate

20:01.980 --> 20:04.720
a Fourier transform in practicality?

20:04.720 --> 20:06.520
You would do something like a DFT,

20:06.520 --> 20:08.020
a speed Fourier transform.

20:08.020 --> 20:10.780
Or we can do it for some, within a particular domain,

20:10.780 --> 20:12.920
we can calculate the Fourier transform

20:12.920 --> 20:15.120
for as long as we know the values, right?

20:15.120 --> 20:17.680
But you'll always have a scatter.

20:17.680 --> 20:20.560
Because I'll have basically kind of an excellent data process

20:20.560 --> 20:23.280
which never terminates, right?

20:23.280 --> 20:26.220
I say that, okay, this point lies between this and this,

20:26.220 --> 20:28.320
and you say, no, it's actually finer than that,

20:28.320 --> 20:30.920
it's finer than that, and the process never concludes.

20:33.620 --> 20:36.380
So ask yourself, how do I construct this crystal?

20:36.520 --> 20:38.820
Can you place it at that point?

20:38.820 --> 20:44.580
And that that point is not well defined, right?

20:48.120 --> 20:52.320
Okay, so now let's connect wave function, this structure.

20:52.320 --> 20:53.760
I mentioned this expression

20:53.760 --> 20:56.760
when we talked about two different energy regimes,

20:56.760 --> 21:00.360
where Uwm is the cell function,

21:00.360 --> 21:02.280
which is the part of the wave function

21:02.280 --> 21:05.480
that represents the strong interaction between an electron,

21:05.480 --> 21:06.520
and an .

21:06.520 --> 21:08.700
and the second part

21:08.700 --> 21:10.740
is a familiar plane wave

21:10.740 --> 21:12.860
so if you had

21:12.860 --> 21:14.460
open, like you know

21:14.460 --> 21:16.700
the universe constructed of

21:16.700 --> 21:19.100
an infinite space

21:19.100 --> 21:20.340
and only one electron

21:20.340 --> 21:25.360
e to the power ikr would be a sufficient

21:25.360 --> 21:27.280
representation of what that electron wave function

21:27.280 --> 21:29.340
would be, right, because it doesn't interact

21:29.340 --> 21:30.760
with anything because nothing else exists

21:30.760 --> 21:33.020
in fact, John Archibald

21:33.020 --> 21:34.380
was a physicist

21:34.380 --> 21:37.100
was a PhD advisor of Richard Feynman

21:37.100 --> 21:39.340
he had this theory that there is only

21:39.340 --> 21:41.320
one electron in the entire universe and everything else

21:41.320 --> 21:43.080
is a motion transferred copy of that

21:43.080 --> 21:44.600
pretty crazy idea

21:44.600 --> 21:47.280
but it seems to fit the facts

21:47.280 --> 21:48.240
so

21:48.240 --> 21:51.320
the cell function of the kernel

21:51.320 --> 21:53.360
is what we are defining as

21:53.360 --> 21:55.420
u sub n, it interacts with the lattice

21:55.420 --> 21:59.120
crystals

21:59.120 --> 22:01.460
this is important to understand that even though

22:01.460 --> 22:03.040
we talk about

22:03.040 --> 22:04.220
crystals having symmetry

22:04.220 --> 22:06.740
but the act of construction of the crystal

22:06.740 --> 22:08.260
actually breaks space symmetry

22:08.260 --> 22:10.980
because space symmetry says that all directions

22:10.980 --> 22:11.920
in R3 are equivalent

22:11.920 --> 22:14.660
so once I construct a crystal

22:14.660 --> 22:16.940
I say that okay, some directions are more special

22:16.940 --> 22:17.480
than others

22:17.480 --> 22:20.820
and as a result, first of all there is symmetry breaking

22:20.820 --> 22:23.000
that occurs, so all directions are not

22:23.000 --> 22:24.760
equivalent, so this for example

22:24.760 --> 22:26.300
is a diamond crystal lattice

22:26.300 --> 22:28.740
which is what silicon and germanium

22:28.740 --> 22:29.460
condense into

22:29.460 --> 22:32.440
so just there as an example

22:32.440 --> 22:33.840
so what does that depend upon?

22:34.220 --> 22:38.540
each will break symmetry in one way or the other

22:38.540 --> 22:42.980
once you have a crystal then there is periodicity

22:42.980 --> 22:44.840
but when you say periodicity

22:44.840 --> 22:47.060
and you try to construct a miller index

22:47.060 --> 22:49.060
you are still saying that there are at least

22:49.060 --> 22:50.240
three special directions

22:50.240 --> 22:54.080
periodicity is different from symmetry

22:54.080 --> 22:59.240
periodicity is what I would say

22:59.240 --> 22:59.700
okay

22:59.700 --> 23:02.860
I think there is a slight abuse of terminology over here

23:04.220 --> 23:07.780
what we are talking about basic symmetry in R3 is

23:07.780 --> 23:08.940
isotropicity of space

23:08.940 --> 23:10.420
that all directions are equivalent

23:10.420 --> 23:12.620
the moment I impose a crystal

23:12.620 --> 23:15.600
that basic R3 symmetry is broken

23:15.600 --> 23:17.720
and we say that the resulting space is anisotropic

23:17.720 --> 23:20.060
and now within that

23:20.060 --> 23:21.980
anisotropic space we have got periodicity

23:21.980 --> 23:23.880
and that periodicity

23:23.880 --> 23:25.280
in the sense of a group theory

23:25.280 --> 23:27.500
obviously imposes a certain set of

23:27.500 --> 23:29.960
special directions in which there is

23:29.960 --> 23:31.180
periodicity and hence

23:31.180 --> 23:32.220
that is symmetry

23:32.220 --> 23:34.200
so we are using

23:34.220 --> 23:35.700
symmetry in two different terms

23:35.700 --> 23:36.400
in two different ways

23:36.400 --> 23:36.960
they are actually

23:36.960 --> 23:38.920
it is correct to use the word symmetry over here

23:38.920 --> 23:41.380
because R3 symmetry is the basic symmetry of all

23:41.380 --> 23:42.620
which is basically

23:42.620 --> 23:44.500
I think it is called

23:44.500 --> 23:45.400
n-fold or something

23:45.400 --> 23:46.260
okay never mind

23:46.260 --> 23:47.040
what it is called

23:47.040 --> 23:49.960
it is been a while since I have read these things

23:49.960 --> 23:51.960
but

23:51.960 --> 23:53.600
isotropicity

23:53.600 --> 23:55.020
and symmetry combined together

23:55.020 --> 23:56.860
those two terms will actually clarify

23:56.860 --> 23:58.180
what we are talking about

23:58.180 --> 23:59.680
so isotropicity is broken

23:59.680 --> 24:01.180
which is also known as R3 symmetry

24:01.180 --> 24:03.220
so it is like when you didn't have a crystal

24:03.220 --> 24:04.140
that any vectoring

24:04.220 --> 24:06.520
R3 was equally probable

24:06.520 --> 24:09.460
or there was no special energy direction anywhere

24:09.460 --> 24:10.620
so when you impose a crystal

24:10.620 --> 24:13.880
so that say a particular direction became more favourable for that crystal

24:13.880 --> 24:15.380
more favourable or less favourable

24:15.380 --> 24:16.120
less favourable

24:16.120 --> 24:17.260
and non-equivalent basically

24:17.260 --> 24:19.040
that is what we are trying to say

24:19.040 --> 24:20.840
what is the fact that over here

24:20.840 --> 24:22.280
the kernel is u sub n

24:22.280 --> 24:23.560
I call it the self-function

24:23.560 --> 24:30.160
and it is also known as kernel in many treatments

24:30.160 --> 24:31.620
now mobility

24:31.620 --> 24:32.400
I have still not

24:32.400 --> 24:34.060
I have not defined mobility please note

24:34.060 --> 24:35.620
I have not given the units of mobility

24:35.620 --> 24:37.100
I have not defined what unity is

24:37.100 --> 24:38.260
mobility is in

24:38.260 --> 24:40.660
you know what is the right-hand side of that equation

24:40.660 --> 24:42.060
but mobility we

24:42.060 --> 24:43.620
can right now state

24:43.620 --> 24:48.900
it is the measure of how easy it is for a carrier to move

24:48.900 --> 24:50.860
carrier or electron?

24:50.860 --> 24:51.620
electron is a carrier

24:51.620 --> 24:54.260
there is going to be a second carrier introduced to this discussion

24:54.260 --> 24:57.560
that I am generalizing into a carrier

24:57.560 --> 25:00.100
so it is a strong function of scattering interactions

25:00.100 --> 25:02.120
the more scattering you have

25:02.120 --> 25:03.860
the harder it is for the carrier to move

25:04.060 --> 25:04.560
right?

25:04.560 --> 25:06.200
can everybody understand that?

25:06.200 --> 25:11.020
okay

25:11.020 --> 25:14.160
so one thing that happens in this entire process is that

25:14.160 --> 25:16.320
we start with the assumption that electron for instance

25:16.320 --> 25:17.760
has a mass of 9.11

25:17.760 --> 25:21.520
10 to the power minus 31 kilograms

25:21.520 --> 25:23.500
in semiconductor devices

25:23.500 --> 25:26.400
we don't use that mass much

25:26.400 --> 25:28.700
instead we replace it with something called an effective mass

25:28.700 --> 25:30.560
and I will describe two ways

25:30.560 --> 25:33.900
two distinct and two distinct ways in which that is constructed

25:34.060 --> 25:36.560
so that is what I am

25:36.560 --> 25:40.120
so is that because of rest mass or moving mass?

25:40.120 --> 25:41.420
no

25:41.420 --> 25:43.120
that is relativity

25:43.120 --> 25:45.360
in that case if your speed goes up the mass goes up

25:45.360 --> 25:47.420
no that is not what you are talking about

25:47.420 --> 25:48.800
so let us now

25:48.800 --> 25:50.620
describe the first of those two masses

25:50.620 --> 25:52.860
there are two ways of defining effective mass

25:52.860 --> 25:55.200
both are necessary for you to understand

25:55.200 --> 25:57.520
because both are needed in different contexts

25:57.520 --> 26:00.220
so let us first define a kinematic effective mass

26:00.220 --> 26:02.920
so when a carrier moves through crystal it interacts with what?

26:02.920 --> 26:03.600
so when a carrier moves through crystal it interacts with what?

26:03.600 --> 26:04.740
the lattice

26:04.740 --> 26:06.940
that is the obvious culprit right?

26:06.940 --> 26:08.360
other carriers

26:08.360 --> 26:11.940
electron-electron interactions or hole-hole interactions

26:11.940 --> 26:14.260
and also stuff that should not be there

26:14.260 --> 26:16.060
impurities

26:16.060 --> 26:17.100
Joukalski process

26:17.100 --> 26:18.400
carbon impurities in silicon

26:18.400 --> 26:21.060
that is what we are talking about

26:21.060 --> 26:25.160
it is very different from free space transport

26:25.160 --> 26:29.900
so if we write down the equation of motion

26:29.900 --> 26:33.000
notice that I have pulled m inside the derivative

26:33.000 --> 26:33.500
ok?

26:33.500 --> 26:36.640
because I am writing the rate of change of momentum there

26:36.640 --> 26:39.340
is equal to three different forces

26:39.340 --> 26:40.800
one is the externally applied force

26:40.800 --> 26:42.300
so this could be a piece of silicon

26:42.300 --> 26:44.060
and apply an electric field across it

26:44.060 --> 26:46.460
that is an external force

26:46.460 --> 26:47.600
the other is periodic force

26:47.600 --> 26:49.400
I have got a crystal

26:49.400 --> 26:53.040
the carrier moving in one direction is going to see the same kind of scattering

26:53.040 --> 26:54.740
or roughly the same kind of scattering

26:54.740 --> 26:56.760
modulo the temperature differences

26:56.760 --> 26:58.540
as it hops from place to place

26:58.540 --> 27:01.900
because the lattice structure of it is periodic in itself

27:01.900 --> 27:02.640
and other?

27:02.640 --> 27:04.440
unexpected things

27:04.440 --> 27:07.240
like electron-electron interactions

27:07.240 --> 27:09.980
after all it is not a single electron system

27:09.980 --> 27:13.040
and the other thing is impurities

27:13.040 --> 27:15.500
which break periodicity by the way

27:15.500 --> 27:17.200
because if I have silicon

27:17.200 --> 27:19.980
and I suddenly introduce a phosphorus atom in there

27:19.980 --> 27:23.640
which is where you actually make n-type silicon

27:23.640 --> 27:26.940
phosphorus has a different valency and a different covalent bonding

27:26.940 --> 27:27.780
than silicon does

27:27.780 --> 27:29.580
so it will disrupt the electron cloud

27:29.580 --> 27:31.640
and break periodicity in that sense

27:31.640 --> 27:32.480
ok sir can I ask a question?

27:32.480 --> 27:34.540
periodicity what does that mean?

27:34.540 --> 27:38.340
periodic is like if you have got an infinite silicon crystal

27:38.340 --> 27:41.380
so if your electron is moving in a single direction

27:41.380 --> 27:44.520
without getting captured in different directions

27:44.520 --> 27:47.040
it is going to encounter the same kind of collisions

27:47.040 --> 27:48.940
you know roughly

27:48.940 --> 27:49.880
a given unit of time

27:49.880 --> 27:51.180
like it is moving at a constant velocity

27:51.180 --> 27:51.840
it is going to take time

27:51.840 --> 27:53.880
we are just accounting it for the lattice forces

27:53.880 --> 27:54.640
yes

27:54.640 --> 27:57.340
just that f periodic is lattice

27:57.340 --> 27:59.080
but the lattice may contain impurities

27:59.080 --> 28:01.180
and that impurity part is an extra layer

28:01.180 --> 28:01.880
so what?

28:01.880 --> 28:06.580
so when we say periodic do we also account for lattice vibrations being the same?

28:06.580 --> 28:07.580
no we don't

28:07.580 --> 28:11.080
we in fact I mentioned that earlier in this lecture

28:11.080 --> 28:13.840
we replace vibrations with the quasi particles

28:13.840 --> 28:16.740
and then that would get pushed into f other

28:16.740 --> 28:21.080
because f other contains everything else that is not a part of the perfect lattice

28:21.080 --> 28:23.740
or an externally invited force

28:23.740 --> 28:28.140
now how do you track the motion of any carrier?

28:28.140 --> 28:30.320
one electron?

28:30.320 --> 28:31.040
I read on the equation of motion I tried to track that one electron?

28:31.040 --> 28:31.540
one electron? I read on the equation of motion I tried to track that one electron?

28:31.540 --> 28:37.940
see those of you who were getting a slight sense of Deja Vu

28:37.940 --> 28:40.180
from maybe 10th grade or 11th grade

28:40.180 --> 28:42.080
where you started talking about how

28:42.080 --> 28:46.440
solid bodies can be replaced with a single centre of mass

28:46.440 --> 28:48.540
and treat it as a particle

28:48.540 --> 28:51.480
this direction this discussion is going to be somewhat similar

28:51.480 --> 28:52.440
in spirit

28:52.440 --> 28:54.540
not in detail

28:54.540 --> 28:55.600
so

28:55.600 --> 28:58.400
we're gonna say okay this is external force acting on it

28:58.400 --> 28:59.280
this is a force acting on it from the lattice itself and this is from everything else, right?

28:59.280 --> 29:00.380
I can't do it, right?

29:00.380 --> 29:00.900
if I can't do it, no problem!

29:00.900 --> 29:01.400
I can't do it, right?

29:01.540 --> 29:13.540
Well, that's easy enough to do for one particle. If you have any silicon crystal, let's say

29:13.540 --> 29:21.540
containing a mole of silicon atoms, like Avogadro number, do you write down 10 to the power

29:21.540 --> 29:26.540
of 53 such equations? No. See, it's the same kind of reasoning as you use for the rigid

29:26.540 --> 29:35.540
bodies. So, mathematically that problem is intractable. So, what I do instead is that

29:35.540 --> 29:46.540
we modify the definition of mass itself. So, I replace m0 with mn star, n refers to electron.

29:46.540 --> 29:51.540
This is going to be a kind of protocol going forward. n refers to electron and t refers

29:51.540 --> 29:56.540
to hole. We will come to a hole in a short while. So, what refers to star? Star is the

29:56.540 --> 29:58.540
particle indicating that it's not your normal mass. It's an effective mass.
