0	8620	Okay. So packaging and the fact that it
8620	16760	is the highest value in some sense,
16760	22720	what we are teaching in this class is
22720	24600	only what I would call
24600	27980	20 percent of the overall amount of materials.
27980	31220	This is not to say that this is just
31220	37140	some pre-designed bug that we just use as a standard package.
37960	43420	Packaging is used to be considered like an art in itself,
43420	47980	but now increasingly because of the heat issues,
47980	50260	people no longer speak about
50260	52780	integrated software in the package separately.
52780	56360	Instead, they talk about packaging of systems.
56480	57980	That means that
57980	64380	heat core design or thermal core design has to be a part of the IC design process itself.
64380	67300	Unfortunately, as far as I know,
67300	71340	only one course in any of the IITs in India,
71340	75960	IIT Bombay, actually teaches IC design in that way.
75960	79500	Even our VLSI design program over here,
79500	82840	talks about IC design in isolation more or less.
82840	85960	It doesn't make all the grammars. Can I help you?
85960	86960	Yes, please.
86960	87960	Okay.
87980	91260	See, if you can send all the stuff together at one point,
91260	92060	I'll be able to help you.
92060	94440	But if you keep coming every five minutes to interrupt me,
94440	95440	that's not really the problem.
95440	97540	Please, please, please don't.
98560	106540	So, the issue is that this kind of
106540	109480	fragmented knowledge forces people to take
109480	113460	electives in domains that they don't consider their own.
113460	116860	For instance, mechanical engineering has a big input here because heat transfer is
116860	117940	a central part of
117980	119220	that study.
119220	125520	As a part of the ISN-India's Immigration Commission,
125520	128340	the most publicly publicized part of this is
128340	131100	for me and I, could probably participate in initiative.
131100	135880	Which can also be a part of .
135880	142880	So, one of the lift well know concepts,
142880	144980	they have a lot of people going there.
144980	146040	I will try to figure out something out for you.
146040	146660	They remain at least one guysbelen beras in compliance with theceeding.
146660	146920	I would like to ask you that question recordings there.
146920	146980	Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. No problem.
146980	147040	Okay. Thank you.
147040	147060	Yes.
147080	147220	Yes Puwa≈Ç...
147220	147240	Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes followed by the Infrastructure Again.
147240	147620	Okay. Yes. Yes. Yes. Uh...black background and one of the rest publications
147620	147780	who is actually going there too?
147780	157780	I know parts of activism are even in the whole education system when it comes to this part of technology research and development.
157780	166780	And there, certain new VTech or MTech programs are going to be offered in a few years,
166780	171780	which are entirely geared about taking elements of various traditional practices of engineering
171780	177780	and offering them as, you know, semiconductor devices or something like that.
177780	184780	So this packaging issue is not just something that you can learn later on your own.
184780	190780	I recommend that if you are interested in going into this field, start looking for corresponding electives,
190780	195780	because you will not have the time to learn heat transfer from scratch after you've completed your VTech,
195780	200780	or you're late into your MTech, etc. It's just one of the matters.
200780	201780	Then we shall come back to this.
201780	204780	We'll start it, resume our discussion.
204780	206780	This part was prompted by a student question.
206780	214780	But then we resume our discussion on what happens to carrier wave functions in various kinds of materials,
214780	219780	starting from the understanding that only in a perfectly periodic crystal do you have black-hot scattering.
219780	223780	In any room temperature case, you will not have a perfect crystal.
223780	230780	You will have vibrations, which give rise to virtual particles known as phonons.
230780	236780	In a second quantization sense, interact with carriers, and that leads to scattering.
236780	246780	We defined an R-space, which is easy enough to understand, in one dimension, two dimensions, and three dimensions.
246780	252780	But there is a dual space to that, which arises from Fourier transforms, which is also periodic.
252780	259780	And if you are starting in the Bravais lattice, one of those 14 lattices,
259780	264780	then its dual space is known as a reciprocal lattice.
264780	268780	And the reciprocal lattice is guaranteed to be also a Bravais lattice.
268780	274780	Of course, there is no guarantee that Bravais lattice A maps into reciprocal lattice A.
274780	282780	It could be B, where B is also a set of initial Bravais lattices that we started with.
282780	284780	Then we had a simple class problem.
284780	288780	We defined planes, classes of planes.
288780	293780	We defined families of planes which are parallel to each other, or depending upon the nature of symmetry.
293780	297780	They may even be orthogonal, but they have the same symmetry in that direction.
297780	305780	The practical influence of understanding of planes is that it allows you to
305780	311780	please wafers without actually shattering them and losing a lot of material,
311780	317780	and also causing edge issues, because you want to use the entire real estate as much as possible.
317780	320780	We defined waferents in real space, corresponding to that,
320780	325780	because of the relationship between the periodicity r and the periodicity k,
325780	332780	is that if ikr, essentially, is equal to a constant, or 1, depending on your normalization,
332780	335780	is also a waferent.
335780	337780	So if r is a waferent, k is also a waferent.
337780	340780	That's the property of plane waves.
340780	346780	Then we formally defined the reciprocal lattice, and we expanded on the Fourier part.
347780	351780	Let's today connect this more to crystallography.
351780	355780	You've all seen Miller's analysis? Have you?
355780	357780	No.
357780	363780	So those of you who did coordinate geometry, and I think it was all of you in 11th grade,
363780	367780	you know how to write down the equation of a plane, right?
367780	373780	One of the canonical forms of the equation of a plane is a dot n equal to a constant, right?
373780	376780	Which is also the biggest discussion.
377780	383780	So, Miller indices, in that sense, are an exercise in finding the normal to the plane.
383780	387780	As long as you can write the normal to the plane, which is the equation of the plane effectively,
387780	390780	you can figure out where the indices are.
390780	397780	So, the area vector for a plane is picked to be parallel to the shortest reciprocal lattice vector.
397780	405780	So notice that, in coordinate geometry, the direction that is perpendicular to the plane is also in r3.
405780	406780	Right?
406780	410780	So, if you're starting with a plane arbitrarily oriented in r3,
410780	413780	then the vector that is perpendicular is also in r3.
413780	416780	But here we're making a departure from that.
416780	421780	We're saying that if you have a plane in real space,
421780	429780	then its vertical is a point in reciprocal space which has a k-position vector.
429780	432780	It's just a change of terminology. That is all there.
432780	434780	Let me repeat.
434780	438780	If you have a plane which is arbitrarily oriented in r3,
438780	440780	I find it's normal.
440780	444780	The coordinates, which is basically a triplet,
444780	449780	is a point in k-space.
449780	450780	Same coordinates.
450780	452780	So, let's say 3, 1, 5.
452780	457780	Those are coordinates in k-space for the dual vector.
457780	460780	So, if you have a plane in this direction, it maps to a point.
460780	462780	A position vector, to be more precise.
462780	463780	Yes?
463780	467780	You're taking the normal to that plane and then mapping it to a point in k-space.
467780	470780	You're just taking those coordinates and we will describe,
470780	473780	because obviously people who work in crystallography
473780	476780	are not very comfortable with working on Fourier analysis.
476780	478780	So, they have their own way of arriving at the same thing,
478780	481780	which I'll describe how to construct a Miller index.
481780	483780	It is essentially the same process.
483780	485780	If you have done a little bit of linear algebra,
485780	487780	which I believe you have done,
487780	488780	you can work out the steps and you'll say,
488780	490780	okay, yeah, these two treatments are exactly equivalent.
490780	491780	Sir, but for a plane like,
491780	493780	we can't only depend on one model vector.
493780	494780	We should also have a point, right?
494780	496780	So, we will have to consider that when doing this.
496780	497780	Which point?
497780	499780	Meaning, if you have a normal vector,
499780	501780	infinite planes which have a normal vector.
501780	502780	Yeah.
502780	504780	So, all you say is that if I define its normal vector,
504780	507780	any normal which is a scalar multiple of that normal vector
507780	509780	will also serve as a normal vector.
509780	511780	What we're trying to find over here is the minimum normal vector.
511780	513780	But I'm telling you that if there are infinite planes
513780	514780	for the same normal vector, right?
514780	515780	Yes, yes, yes.
515780	519780	So, this basically goes back to our previous discussion,
519780	523780	where families of planes corresponded to a single point in k-space.
523780	524780	Okay.
524780	526780	So, how do you construct a family of planes
526780	528780	that are all parallel to each other?
528780	531780	So, that discussion is exactly equivalent.
531780	534780	So, you pick a parallel,
534780	537780	but you pick the shortest reciprocal lattice vector
537780	542780	and let us express that in three unit coordinates,
542780	544780	or rather three unit vectors,
544780	546780	in the linear space defined by b1, b2, b3,
546780	548780	which I have bolded there.
548780	550780	How do you construct it?
550780	552780	It is the smallest integral coefficient
552780	557780	in reciprocal space.
557780	561780	So, you basically write it as,
561780	565780	so if you have like this coordinate system in,
565780	567780	I think, red or black?
567780	568780	Yeah, black.
568780	570780	It is in real space.
570780	573780	Then you construct a coordinate system in red.
573780	577780	That is the corresponding coordinate system in k-space.
577780	580780	So, they are not, so black is r3,
580780	582780	red is k3.
582780	585780	And we are finding out
585780	589780	the corresponding minimum intercepts
589780	594780	a by h, b by k and c by l.
594780	596780	And we are trying to find out h, k and l,
596780	598780	which are the smallest integers
598780	600780	which will make this possible.
600780	603780	So, for instance, you have got 7 by 11 or something.
603780	607780	Then 11 is the corresponding, you know,
607780	609780	coordinate I have to worry about.
609780	611780	Can you repeat it?
611780	615780	So, what we are trying to do over here is,
615780	618780	we are trying to find out coordinates in b-space,
618780	620780	which is, you know, effectively mapping of k-space,
620780	622780	h, k, l,
622780	625780	so that you have b by,
625780	628780	you are finding h, k and l,
628780	631780	so that they are the smallest possible integer multiples
631780	632780	in each direction.
632780	633780	Yeah?
633780	635780	The numbers you said.
635780	636780	Yeah?
636780	639780	The numbers you said, 7, 5, 11, I didn't get.
639780	640780	So, we will give you a worked example.
640780	647780	You will probably understand from that more clearly.
647780	650780	So, crystallographic definition,
650780	652780	which is independent of, you know,
652780	654780	Fourier definition is that
654780	657780	it is the inverse proportionality of intercepts in real space.
657780	659780	So, for instance,
659780	661780	if I have an arbitrarily oriented plane,
661780	663780	which has intercepts,
663780	666780	let's say x1, x2, x3,
666780	668780	then the corresponding 1 over x1,
668780	669780	1 over x2,
669780	670780	1 over x3,
670780	672780	expressed in smallest integer form,
672780	676780	will be the corresponding h, k, l's.
676780	678780	I take the inverse,
678780	681780	and I find out the l, c, m, in some sense,
681780	682780	for those,
682780	684780	and those are h, k, l's,
684780	687780	with no bound factors.
687780	691780	So, for hexagonal and robohedral lattices,
691780	693780	it is more convenient to use four indices,
693780	696780	even though we are not talking about a four-dimensional space,
696780	698780	because there is an additional axis,
698780	700780	which is a c-axis in the road direction,
700780	702780	you would present that using the fourth index.
702780	705780	This is just specific to these two crystal structures.
705780	706780	It is not necessary,
706780	708780	it is entirely possible to express it in three,
708780	709780	because it's after all,
709780	711780	after a k3, you don't need more than that,
711780	714780	but you can have an over-determined plane,
714780	715780	for instance.
715780	716780	It is equivalent to saying that,
716780	718780	okay, I've got three non-polar points,
718780	720780	and they define my plane,
720780	722780	and I just happen to pick another fourth point
722780	724780	on the same plane to define my plane.
724780	727780	Makes no difference, really speaking.
727780	729780	So, why do we do that?
729780	732780	It's easier to express it,
732780	736780	because there are, you know, additional axes here.
736780	737780	So, let's do a class problem,
737780	740780	and that will hopefully clear up some of these doubts.
740780	742780	So, here is the problem.
742780	744780	This plane in red, light red,
744780	747780	I hope everybody can see that.
747780	749780	It has these points defined,
749780	751780	a and b,
751780	752780	and the Miller indices,
752780	754780	for this indicated plane.
757780	761780	All right, so how many of these,
761780	762780	what you heard is just one point.
762780	765780	You'll remember again and again from our Himalayan class,
765780	767780	were also an episode three.
767780	769780	Sir, did I also drink another body of water?
769780	770780	Yeah.
770780	773780	That's obvious, right?
773780	779780	Because Z cure is 0 in both cases.
787780	817760	Thank you.
817780	847760	Thank you.
847780	877760	Thank you.
877780	907760	Thank you.
907780	937760	Thank you.
937780	967760	Thank you.
967780	997760	Thank you.
997780	1027760	Thank you.
1027780	1057760	Thank you.
1057780	1087760	Thank you.
1087780	1117760	Thank you.
1117780	1147760	Thank you.
1147780	1177760	Thank you.
1177780	1181720	of irrational points, like it could occur.
1181720	1183280	Of course, we have got non-periodic systems
1183280	1184880	like polycrystalline and morpher systems,
1184880	1186280	they're not periodic either.
1187280	1192280	Those are non-irrational examples of non-periodic systems.
1192280	1194880	So for the non-periodic system,
1194880	1197780	we cannot define the Fourier transform
1197780	1199820	or there are no .
1199820	1201980	Well, how would you calculate
1201980	1204720	a Fourier transform in practicality?
1204720	1206520	You would do something like a DFT,
1206520	1208020	a speed Fourier transform.
1208020	1210780	Or we can do it for some, within a particular domain,
1210780	1212920	we can calculate the Fourier transform
1212920	1215120	for as long as we know the values, right?
1215120	1217680	But you'll always have a scatter.
1217680	1220560	Because I'll have basically kind of an excellent data process
1220560	1223280	which never terminates, right?
1223280	1226220	I say that, okay, this point lies between this and this,
1226220	1228320	and you say, no, it's actually finer than that,
1228320	1230920	it's finer than that, and the process never concludes.
1233620	1236380	So ask yourself, how do I construct this crystal?
1236520	1238820	Can you place it at that point?
1238820	1244580	And that that point is not well defined, right?
1248120	1252320	Okay, so now let's connect wave function, this structure.
1252320	1253760	I mentioned this expression
1253760	1256760	when we talked about two different energy regimes,
1256760	1260360	where Uwm is the cell function,
1260360	1262280	which is the part of the wave function
1262280	1265480	that represents the strong interaction between an electron,
1265480	1266520	and an .
1266520	1268700	and the second part
1268700	1270740	is a familiar plane wave
1270740	1272860	so if you had
1272860	1274460	open, like you know
1274460	1276700	the universe constructed of
1276700	1279100	an infinite space
1279100	1280340	and only one electron
1280340	1285360	e to the power ikr would be a sufficient
1285360	1287280	representation of what that electron wave function
1287280	1289340	would be, right, because it doesn't interact
1289340	1290760	with anything because nothing else exists
1290760	1293020	in fact, John Archibald
1293020	1294380	was a physicist
1294380	1297100	was a PhD advisor of Richard Feynman
1297100	1299340	he had this theory that there is only
1299340	1301320	one electron in the entire universe and everything else
1301320	1303080	is a motion transferred copy of that
1303080	1304600	pretty crazy idea
1304600	1307280	but it seems to fit the facts
1307280	1308240	so
1308240	1311320	the cell function of the kernel
1311320	1313360	is what we are defining as
1313360	1315420	u sub n, it interacts with the lattice
1315420	1319120	crystals
1319120	1321460	this is important to understand that even though
1321460	1323040	we talk about
1323040	1324220	crystals having symmetry
1324220	1326740	but the act of construction of the crystal
1326740	1328260	actually breaks space symmetry
1328260	1330980	because space symmetry says that all directions
1330980	1331920	in R3 are equivalent
1331920	1334660	so once I construct a crystal
1334660	1336940	I say that okay, some directions are more special
1336940	1337480	than others
1337480	1340820	and as a result, first of all there is symmetry breaking
1340820	1343000	that occurs, so all directions are not
1343000	1344760	equivalent, so this for example
1344760	1346300	is a diamond crystal lattice
1346300	1348740	which is what silicon and germanium
1348740	1349460	condense into
1349460	1352440	so just there as an example
1352440	1353840	so what does that depend upon?
1354220	1358540	each will break symmetry in one way or the other
1358540	1362980	once you have a crystal then there is periodicity
1362980	1364840	but when you say periodicity
1364840	1367060	and you try to construct a miller index
1367060	1369060	you are still saying that there are at least
1369060	1370240	three special directions
1370240	1374080	periodicity is different from symmetry
1374080	1379240	periodicity is what I would say
1379240	1379700	okay
1379700	1382860	I think there is a slight abuse of terminology over here
1384220	1387780	what we are talking about basic symmetry in R3 is
1387780	1388940	isotropicity of space
1388940	1390420	that all directions are equivalent
1390420	1392620	the moment I impose a crystal
1392620	1395600	that basic R3 symmetry is broken
1395600	1397720	and we say that the resulting space is anisotropic
1397720	1400060	and now within that
1400060	1401980	anisotropic space we have got periodicity
1401980	1403880	and that periodicity
1403880	1405280	in the sense of a group theory
1405280	1407500	obviously imposes a certain set of
1407500	1409960	special directions in which there is
1409960	1411180	periodicity and hence
1411180	1412220	that is symmetry
1412220	1414200	so we are using
1414220	1415700	symmetry in two different terms
1415700	1416400	in two different ways
1416400	1416960	they are actually
1416960	1418920	it is correct to use the word symmetry over here
1418920	1421380	because R3 symmetry is the basic symmetry of all
1421380	1422620	which is basically
1422620	1424500	I think it is called
1424500	1425400	n-fold or something
1425400	1426260	okay never mind
1426260	1427040	what it is called
1427040	1429960	it is been a while since I have read these things
1429960	1431960	but
1431960	1433600	isotropicity
1433600	1435020	and symmetry combined together
1435020	1436860	those two terms will actually clarify
1436860	1438180	what we are talking about
1438180	1439680	so isotropicity is broken
1439680	1441180	which is also known as R3 symmetry
1441180	1443220	so it is like when you didn't have a crystal
1443220	1444140	that any vectoring
1444220	1446520	R3 was equally probable
1446520	1449460	or there was no special energy direction anywhere
1449460	1450620	so when you impose a crystal
1450620	1453880	so that say a particular direction became more favourable for that crystal
1453880	1455380	more favourable or less favourable
1455380	1456120	less favourable
1456120	1457260	and non-equivalent basically
1457260	1459040	that is what we are trying to say
1459040	1460840	what is the fact that over here
1460840	1462280	the kernel is u sub n
1462280	1463560	I call it the self-function
1463560	1470160	and it is also known as kernel in many treatments
1470160	1471620	now mobility
1471620	1472400	I have still not
1472400	1474060	I have not defined mobility please note
1474060	1475620	I have not given the units of mobility
1475620	1477100	I have not defined what unity is
1477100	1478260	mobility is in
1478260	1480660	you know what is the right-hand side of that equation
1480660	1482060	but mobility we
1482060	1483620	can right now state
1483620	1488900	it is the measure of how easy it is for a carrier to move
1488900	1490860	carrier or electron?
1490860	1491620	electron is a carrier
1491620	1494260	there is going to be a second carrier introduced to this discussion
1494260	1497560	that I am generalizing into a carrier
1497560	1500100	so it is a strong function of scattering interactions
1500100	1502120	the more scattering you have
1502120	1503860	the harder it is for the carrier to move
1504060	1504560	right?
1504560	1506200	can everybody understand that?
1506200	1511020	okay
1511020	1514160	so one thing that happens in this entire process is that
1514160	1516320	we start with the assumption that electron for instance
1516320	1517760	has a mass of 9.11
1517760	1521520	10 to the power minus 31 kilograms
1521520	1523500	in semiconductor devices
1523500	1526400	we don't use that mass much
1526400	1528700	instead we replace it with something called an effective mass
1528700	1530560	and I will describe two ways
1530560	1533900	two distinct and two distinct ways in which that is constructed
1534060	1536560	so that is what I am
1536560	1540120	so is that because of rest mass or moving mass?
1540120	1541420	no
1541420	1543120	that is relativity
1543120	1545360	in that case if your speed goes up the mass goes up
1545360	1547420	no that is not what you are talking about
1547420	1548800	so let us now
1548800	1550620	describe the first of those two masses
1550620	1552860	there are two ways of defining effective mass
1552860	1555200	both are necessary for you to understand
1555200	1557520	because both are needed in different contexts
1557520	1560220	so let us first define a kinematic effective mass
1560220	1562920	so when a carrier moves through crystal it interacts with what?
1562920	1563600	so when a carrier moves through crystal it interacts with what?
1563600	1564740	the lattice
1564740	1566940	that is the obvious culprit right?
1566940	1568360	other carriers
1568360	1571940	electron-electron interactions or hole-hole interactions
1571940	1574260	and also stuff that should not be there
1574260	1576060	impurities
1576060	1577100	Joukalski process
1577100	1578400	carbon impurities in silicon
1578400	1581060	that is what we are talking about
1581060	1585160	it is very different from free space transport
1585160	1589900	so if we write down the equation of motion
1589900	1593000	notice that I have pulled m inside the derivative
1593000	1593500	ok?
1593500	1596640	because I am writing the rate of change of momentum there
1596640	1599340	is equal to three different forces
1599340	1600800	one is the externally applied force
1600800	1602300	so this could be a piece of silicon
1602300	1604060	and apply an electric field across it
1604060	1606460	that is an external force
1606460	1607600	the other is periodic force
1607600	1609400	I have got a crystal
1609400	1613040	the carrier moving in one direction is going to see the same kind of scattering
1613040	1614740	or roughly the same kind of scattering
1614740	1616760	modulo the temperature differences
1616760	1618540	as it hops from place to place
1618540	1621900	because the lattice structure of it is periodic in itself
1621900	1622640	and other?
1622640	1624440	unexpected things
1624440	1627240	like electron-electron interactions
1627240	1629980	after all it is not a single electron system
1629980	1633040	and the other thing is impurities
1633040	1635500	which break periodicity by the way
1635500	1637200	because if I have silicon
1637200	1639980	and I suddenly introduce a phosphorus atom in there
1639980	1643640	which is where you actually make n-type silicon
1643640	1646940	phosphorus has a different valency and a different covalent bonding
1646940	1647780	than silicon does
1647780	1649580	so it will disrupt the electron cloud
1649580	1651640	and break periodicity in that sense
1651640	1652480	ok sir can I ask a question?
1652480	1654540	periodicity what does that mean?
1654540	1658340	periodic is like if you have got an infinite silicon crystal
1658340	1661380	so if your electron is moving in a single direction
1661380	1664520	without getting captured in different directions
1664520	1667040	it is going to encounter the same kind of collisions
1667040	1668940	you know roughly
1668940	1669880	a given unit of time
1669880	1671180	like it is moving at a constant velocity
1671180	1671840	it is going to take time
1671840	1673880	we are just accounting it for the lattice forces
1673880	1674640	yes
1674640	1677340	just that f periodic is lattice
1677340	1679080	but the lattice may contain impurities
1679080	1681180	and that impurity part is an extra layer
1681180	1681880	so what?
1681880	1686580	so when we say periodic do we also account for lattice vibrations being the same?
1686580	1687580	no we don't
1687580	1691080	we in fact I mentioned that earlier in this lecture
1691080	1693840	we replace vibrations with the quasi particles
1693840	1696740	and then that would get pushed into f other
1696740	1701080	because f other contains everything else that is not a part of the perfect lattice
1701080	1703740	or an externally invited force
1703740	1708140	now how do you track the motion of any carrier?
1708140	1710320	one electron?
1710320	1711040	I read on the equation of motion I tried to track that one electron?
1711040	1711540	one electron? I read on the equation of motion I tried to track that one electron?
1711540	1717940	see those of you who were getting a slight sense of Deja Vu
1717940	1720180	from maybe 10th grade or 11th grade
1720180	1722080	where you started talking about how
1722080	1726440	solid bodies can be replaced with a single centre of mass
1726440	1728540	and treat it as a particle
1728540	1731480	this direction this discussion is going to be somewhat similar
1731480	1732440	in spirit
1732440	1734540	not in detail
1734540	1735600	so
1735600	1738400	we're gonna say okay this is external force acting on it
1738400	1739280	this is a force acting on it from the lattice itself and this is from everything else, right?
1739280	1740380	I can't do it, right?
1740380	1740900	if I can't do it, no problem!
1740900	1741400	I can't do it, right?
1741540	1753540	Well, that's easy enough to do for one particle. If you have any silicon crystal, let's say
1753540	1761540	containing a mole of silicon atoms, like Avogadro number, do you write down 10 to the power
1761540	1766540	of 53 such equations? No. See, it's the same kind of reasoning as you use for the rigid
1766540	1775540	bodies. So, mathematically that problem is intractable. So, what I do instead is that
1775540	1786540	we modify the definition of mass itself. So, I replace m0 with mn star, n refers to electron.
1786540	1791540	This is going to be a kind of protocol going forward. n refers to electron and t refers
1791540	1796540	to hole. We will come to a hole in a short while. So, what refers to star? Star is the
1796540	1798540	particle indicating that it's not your normal mass. It's an effective mass.
