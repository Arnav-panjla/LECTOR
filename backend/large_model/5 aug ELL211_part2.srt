1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
So d by 18 of mn star ve

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,660
So ve is the same as before

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:07,740
What I have done over here is

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,720
I have stolen away the periodicity part

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:13,320
So I say that I write another set of equations

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,300
Where I modify the mass

7
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,880
So that I can throw away a vector on the right hand side

8
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,400
This is a mathematical operation

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,000
How do you modify the mass?

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,980
There are two ways in which people modify the mass

11
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:31,260
One way is to actually do really complicated calculations

12
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,400
Which we will go into later

13
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,500
Once I have defined both notions of effective mass

14
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,460
And the other which is always in this

15
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:37,560
Measured mass

16
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,680
How would you measure it?

17
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,240
How would you measure it?

18
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,300
That's what we don't do

19
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:45,880
That's why we have kind of reduced this equation

20
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,260
We don't want to go to the pathway of the first equation

21
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,320
We are desperately trying to avoid that

22
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:51,600
Yes

23
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,040
An equation is made for a single electron

24
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,820
Or it's for the mole of electron?

25
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:57,960
This

26
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,640
This equation

27
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,920
Good question

28
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,680
This question is

29
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,280
The second equation is what I would call a statistical equation

30
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,400
It refers to the average electron

31
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,800
So you expect most electrons to follow this

32
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,880
In that sense of an average

33
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,000
And we can do statistical averaging

34
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,960
Because we are starting with a very very large number

35
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,600
Of 10 to the power 23 of those electrons

36
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,000
Which is

37
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,260
The requirement of statistics

38
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,100
N represents electron

39
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,740
N always represents electron

40
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,500
Sub n always represents electron

41
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,080
Okay so

42
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:27,900
Yeah

43
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,360
Sir what does direction define energy?

44
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,200
Well your velocity is in a particular direction right?

45
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,800
That was earlier also right?

46
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,600
I am coming to that

47
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,440
Coming to that

48
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:38,840
So

49
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,280
What is F periodic?

50
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:40,680
Huh?

51
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,240
F periodic

52
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,160
F periodic is gone

53
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,200
Where is F periodic?

54
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,480
That is the whole reason we consider to be effective mass

55
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,680
Oh okay

56
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,600
Okay

57
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,640
So what is the loss of simplicity?

58
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,760
The mass is no longer a scalar now

59
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,240
Let us think in a little bit

60
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,840
Because we removed the periodicity so

61
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,720
Mass is no longer a scalar

62
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,440
You are in R3

63
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:05,760
I will have to define a different mass for each direction

64
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,560
Because

65
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,560
Okay think about it this way

66
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,720
You are moving in that direction

67
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,360
You are moving in different directions

68
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,720
Has a different set of inertia associated with it

69
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,800
How do we understand mass?

70
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,920
There is more scattering here

71
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,200
I say okay I am not going to worry about scattering arising from periodic sources

72
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,560
I am just going to lump it up into my

73
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,680
In a measure of inertia in that direction

74
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,960
So that is a direction dependence

75
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,960
So that is a direction dependence

76
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,960
So that is a direction dependence

77
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:32,440
And this is what is known as a kinematic definition of effective mass

78
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,680
There is going to be a different definition

79
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,480
It is going to be slightly more complicated

80
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,920
Unrelated to this

81
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,840
But often leads to similar numbers

82
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,840
But not always

83
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,160
The reason we need to understand that

84
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,920
But M star is a vector

85
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,760
M star is not a vector

86
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,640
It is a tensor

87
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,240
So basically it is a 3 by 3 matrix in R3P

88
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:02,080
All the matrixes have all the matrix properties

89
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,440
Right but then there are also cross terms

90
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,840
So whenever we talk about matrices

91
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,360
We say that it is diagonalizable under certain terms

92
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,880
So that you know you have got 0 above 0 at the bottom upper triangular lower triangular

93
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,200
And then there are 3 scalars along the diagonal

94
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,200
Similar to the vector matrix what we have

95
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,480
But in this case you cannot throw away the cross terms

96
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,480
It depends upon what kind of matrix actually you have got

97
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,440
How does that matrix work?

98
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,960
How does it look like?

99
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,960
We are coming to that

100
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:34,960
That is the project that allows me to present something

101
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,960
Okay now let us shell the discussion for a bit

102
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:43,960
And let me go into aspects which talk about construction of the lattice in the first place

103
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,960
Because the second definition arises naturally from there

104
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,960
Okay silicon atom

105
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,960
Let us imagine a universe where a single silicon atom exists

106
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,960
Okay

107
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,960
Obviously we cannot exist in that universe

108
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,960
Because we are not obligated in that

109
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:04,960
The shell structure for silicon is 1s2, 2s2, 2p6, 3s2, 3p2

110
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,960
We have seen this since I don't know 11th grade or something

111
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,960
Let us count is that 14?

112
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,960
Yeah 4 plus 6 plus 4

113
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,960
So I have got these two

114
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,960
What are the red and the blue lines?

115
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,960
Anybody want to guess?

116
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,960
Values?

117
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,960
Singularity

118
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,960
Singularity

119
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,960
Yes

120
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,960
Ground state and excited state

121
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,960
Because we have one single atom here

122
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:35,960
And the two atoms or rather you know the ion core is basically red

123
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,960
Which is at the bottom

124
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:42,960
And the signal electron which is free to move around is kind of shown schematically at the bottom

125
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,960
Okay

126
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,960
What is the red dot?

127
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,960
What is the red dot?

128
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,960
Red dot is the ion core

129
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,960
Basically 14 protons and a certain number of neutrons club together

130
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,960
What is the black dot?

131
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,960
Yeah that is the black dot

132
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,960
So what was the black?

133
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,960
The black dot is the electron that we are talking about right?

134
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,960
Oh

135
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,960
Huh?

136
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,960
Okay

137
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,960
The red core is essentially the nucleus of silicon

138
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,960
And the inner shell which don't participate in ground core

139
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,960
We don't care about

140
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:18,960
Everything except the valence shell

141
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,960
Valence shell is what we are interested in

142
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,960
Right?

143
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,960
Okay

144
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,960
Now let us now bring these two atoms closer to each other

145
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,960
I think you have seen in 11th grade what happens

146
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,960
Molecular orbital forms

147
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,960
Right?

148
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,960
And one of the properties of a molecular orbital are

149
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,960
That each energy level splits into two

150
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,960
Right?

151
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,960
Bonding and anti-bonding

152
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,960
The bonding being more stable and hence lower energy

153
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,960
So the ground state splits into two

154
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,960
Bonding and anti-bonding

155
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,960
And the excited state splits into two

156
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,960
So you have got four energy levels now

157
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,960
So two atoms brought together lead to four energy levels

158
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,960
I think we can start to see the beginning of a geometric sequence here

159
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,960
Sir

160
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,960
Yeah

161
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,960
Let us just consider one of the four energy levels

162
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,960
Yeah

163
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,960
Just to simplify

164
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,960
It will be too complicated to write four different

165
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,960
Okay

166
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:18,960
Now let us see what these states look like

167
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,960
You have all seen this

168
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,960
Atomic orbitals and how they form you know

169
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:22,960
Molecular orbitals

170
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,960
So there is an anti-bonding orbital which consists of a node

171
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,960
On the line connecting the two atoms

172
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,960
Sorry anti-node

173
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,960
Anti-node right

174
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,960
Because that is where the probability density is the minimum

175
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,960
And the bonding orbital means that there is more effective sharing of the electron cloud

176
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,960
Which forms a covalent bond

177
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,960
Hence the term bonding

178
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:46,960
And hence there is a node there

179
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,960
So this is LCAOQ

180
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,960
Kind of remember linear combination of atomic orbitals

181
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,960
That picture

182
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,960
Now let us bring in the number three

183
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,960
What is the below part?

184
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,960
Below part yeah

185
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:03,960
So the below part is basically the energy levels of potential

186
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,960
So each of these carriers carries different energy

187
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,960
It is from the textbook

188
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,960
It is pretty silly to take pictures according to the textbook

189
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,960
So what is this?

190
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,960
Why is there a well here?

191
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,960
Huh?

192
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,960
I mean the below part

193
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,960
There are two iron cores right?

194
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,960
The potential energy heads towards infinity

195
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,960
As the electron gets closer

196
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,960
So those two wells now that is in between

197
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,960
That is you know basically a shallow barrier

198
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,960
Okay

199
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,960
Now let us bring in the number three

200
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,960
Yeah

201
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,960
So you had these four states adding in two more

202
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,960
Eight

203
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,960
So let us see what happens

204
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,960
Eight

205
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,960
Right

206
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,960
So each splits into two again

207
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,960
Now let us carry this process forward

208
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,960
More atoms leads to more energy levels splitting

209
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,960
And if you have molar atoms

210
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,960
You can see this process you know

211
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,960
Going forth

212
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,960
And you basically get a quasi-continuum

213
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,960
Which is

214
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,960
Has a large separation in between

215
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,960
So this is your band gap

216
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,960
So conduction band on the top

217
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,960
Which is constructor and bonding orbitals

218
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,960
And the Williams band on the bottom

219
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,960
Constructing of your bonding orbitals

220
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,960
Okay

221
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:23,960
Okay let us go back

222
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,960
So more atoms lead to more energy levels splitting

223
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,960
And you notice that

224
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,960
You know

225
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,960
The way these gaps are opening up

226
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,960
As a result of that addition process

227
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,960
If I have a large enough

228
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,960
You know of course we cannot sit here and

229
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,960
Go to four, five, six and count up to ten

230
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,960
Partly three that is like silly

231
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,960
But this is what it results in

232
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,960
And these are bands

233
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,960
And the difference between the energy level

234
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,960
Of the lowest anti-bonding orbital

235
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,960
And the highest bonding orbital

236
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,960
Is known as the band gap

237
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,960
Mind you I have not defined what the x-coordinate is

238
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,960
Which is a different story

239
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,960
Only the bicoordinate

240
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,960
X-coordinate

241
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,960
Yeah it does

242
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,960
Massively

243
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,960
In some sense understanding basic semi-character

244
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,960
Is about understanding the x-coordinate

245
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,960
Yeah

246
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,960
You will figure out in a moment why

247
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,960
Yeah

248
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,960
Any questions

249
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,960
So what

250
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,960
So there are more energy levels above this

251
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,960
Uh

252
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,960
So essentially what is an anti-bonding orbital

253
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,960
Where electrons don't have to go

254
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,960
Because they have got higher energy

255
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,960
So even from basic principles we can argue that

256
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,960
Everything in blue over here is unoccupied

257
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,960
Electrons don't have to go there

258
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,960
So they don't have to come home

259
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,960
In organic semiconductors for instance

260
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,960
That is the term that is used

261
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,960
Highest occupied molecular orbital or HOMO

262
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,960
And lowest unoccupied molecular orbital

263
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,960
That is LUMO

264
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,960
But LUMO and HOMO are sharp levels in organics

265
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,960
These are bands

266
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,960
There is a difference

267
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,960
Because in molecular systems

268
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,960
You don't have very very strong interactions

269
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,960
Between different various molecules

270
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,960
That wonder why they interact with each other

271
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:12,960
And hence as a result bands don't form

272
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,960
Okay everybody understand where the band gap now comes from?

273
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:21,960
No

274
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,960
Silicon forms covalent bonds

275
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,960
Gemini forms covalent bonds

276
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,960
Most of the materials you come across

277
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,960
Kalium nitrate whatever

278
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,960
Forms covalent bonds

279
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,960
Bands of this nature

280
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,960
Or something very close to this will form

281
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,960
But if we talk about organic semiconductors

282
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,960
There is a different breed of semiconductors altogether

283
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,960
ALQ3 for instance

284
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,960
It is a complicated

285
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,960
You know

286
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,960
Are you capsized with a name which I don't care to remember or repeat?

287
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,960
You just understand what that name is

288
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,960
When you are writing down a paper

289
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,960
Put it once in a bracket and then forget about it

290
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,960
Is that kind of a name?

291
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,960
I am not a chemist

292
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:01,960
Those interactions between molecules and molecules are not covalent

293
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,960
They are wonder walls

294
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,960
Which means there are weak interactions

295
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,960
Weak interactions means less of energy splitting

296
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,960
Remember

297
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,960
We have to bring atoms very very close to each other

298
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,960
For this energy splitting argument to work

299
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,960
If they remain far apart from each other

300
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,960
Then the perturbation of one atom on the other

301
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,960
Is going to be very very weak

302
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,960
And as a result the splitting will not occur

303
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,960
So that's why bands don't form in organic semiconductors

304
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:27,960
So they basically behave as if they are like

305
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,960
I would say the electrons move through them

306
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,960
In a way of hopping transport

307
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,960
So one side it has an escape probability

308
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,960
It's like a trap

309
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,960
Then go to the next trap

310
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,960
Then go to the next trap

311
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,960
So unsurprisingly the conductivity in organic molecules is off

312
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:45,960
Much weaker than traditional semiconductors of this kind

313
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,960
But anyhow that's what you are going to learn in organic

314
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,960
Sir

315
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,960
Yeah

316
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,960
Sir so the valence band is essentially a bonding orbital

317
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,960
Just like a continuous

318
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,960
It forms a continuum because I got into it 23 years ago

319
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,960
Of course there are subbands inside

320
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,960
And we will learn about subbands later

321
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,960
When we need to

322
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,960
Because there is internal structure to these bands also

323
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:09,960
But we will come to that a bit later

324
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,960
Okay

325
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:17,960
So in keeping with the earlier terminology

326
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:21,960
Valence electrons live in valence band

327
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,960
That they are tightly bound

328
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,960
The K, L, M, shell etc

329
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:28,960
While the conduction electrons which are relatively free to move around

330
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,960
Live in the conduction band

331
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,960
And the business of understanding how much is in each

332
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,960
Will come from statistics

333
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:37,960
So we will get to that later

334
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,960
So another thing

335
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,960
This is now color convention

336
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,960
When it comes to doping

337
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,960
I will be using similar colors here

338
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,960
N is always represented as blue

339
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,960
P is always represented as red

340
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,960
And you will understand why in a moment

341
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,960
Obviously crystal structure arises from minimization of energy

342
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,960
All of you have seen this plot most likely

343
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,960
Right

344
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,960
Two atoms coming together

345
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,960
And you know what is the energy of the electrons

346
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,960
You know that are bound to that

347
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,960
So for hydrogen for instance

348
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:15,960
This energy minimization process leads to a bond length of around 74 picometers

349
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,960
For silicon that number is different

350
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,960
We have previously arrived at what 5 angstroms or something like that

351
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,960
Something like that

352
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:26,960
So each element has its own particular value

353
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,960
And this is now the silicon band structure

354
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,960
This is from your textbook again

355
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,960
So it divides up

356
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,960
So you see

357
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,960
What is the x axis here?

358
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,960
Anybody want to guess?

359
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,960
Distance between the two atoms

360
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,960
Yeah

361
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:48,960
So if I constructed a virtual silicon crystal

362
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,960
Where let's say the virtual is well advised over here

363
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:58,960
Where the distance between neighboring silicon atoms was not 5 angstroms

364
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,960
But was 10 angstroms

365
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,960
Then my band structure would look different

366
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,960
This is where real silicon exists

367
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,960
This dashed line

368
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:14,960
If I go further here then it would look a little bit like this

369
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:19,960
But it's virtual because nature does not construct that material for us

370
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:25,960
Because we have no way of keeping silicon atoms in any silicon crystal further apart than 5 angstroms

371
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,960
Because of lower energy

372
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,960
Yeah

373
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,960
Every system seeks its lowest energy

374
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,960
So it's not going to stay there

375
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,960
But this is basically more like a mathematical model

376
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,960
So what are those lines?

377
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,960
Like at one point you have two lines

378
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,960
Yeah

379
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,960
So these are what are known as sub-bands

380
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,960
Not very well defined here

381
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:45,960
So that is why most people find this figure coming so soon

382
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,960
The text local is a bit indigestible

383
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,960
But I'm just telling you

384
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,960
That there are two concepts here

385
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,960
States and electrons

386
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,960
At least we can agree on that

387
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:59,960
States refers to an electron can exist here

388
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,960
It doesn't mean that it will exist there

389
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,960
It can exist here

390
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,960
While on the other hand

391
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,960
An electron is an electron

392
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,960
It's either there or it's not there

393
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,960
It's a binary choice

394
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:16,960
So it's like the bonding electrons are there and electrons are there

395
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,960
In the anti-bonding also electrons can be there

396
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,960
But they're not usually there because they're anti-bonding orbitals to start with

397
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:27,960
Like if I have a surplus of electrons then it will be there

398
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,960
You'll have to be more clear about what you mean by surplus of electrons

399
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,960
I mean like for silicon there are only 14 electrons

400
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,960
So 4 electrons take place in this bonding-anti-bonding

401
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:40,960
If I had say a different atom with say 18 electrons

402
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,960
It'll also have a different band structure

403
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,960
For the same

404
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,960
If it had the same band structure then it would be okay

405
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,960
But again then we're talking about a virtual material

406
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,960
Yeah

407
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,960
Okay

408
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,960
So why is it always an integer multiple?

409
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,960
Because we count electrons

410
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,960
There's no such thing as 1.3 electrons

411
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,960
So it's an integer multiple of the number of electrons

412
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:04,960
I mean if you have zero electrons how can you have three minor states in the total state?

413
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:10,960
See four n states means that there are that many places for electrons to go set

414
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,960
But they're not sitting there at present

415
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:19,960
Do these states have to be equal in the conduction band and valence band or are they different?

416
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,960
They can be different, depends on your bandwidth

417
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:26,960
It depends on how many bonding and what is the energy level difference between bonding and anti-bonding and etc.

418
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,960
Again multiple depends completely

419
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,960
But what is the use of this diagram if we cannot create such a diagram?

420
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:39,960
The use of this diagram is for you to get an early flavour of that

421
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:46,960
The concept of a state being available and the concept of an electron actually populating that state are two different ideas

422
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:53,960
We will based on, you know, driven or motivated by this diagram calculate the number of states available

423
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:57,960
And also the correspondence that is needed to populate those states

424
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:01,960
The combination of the two will give us certain important quantities

425
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:05,960
And that we want to possibly by next next lecture

426
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:11,960
Sir but in this diagram the only part of the diagram that we ever will really work with is the

427
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:15,960
The dashed line, the rest are all virtual materials

428
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:22,960
The dashed line, the vertical dashed line, that is real silicon, the rest is all virtual silicon

429
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,960
Right? Okay

430
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:29,960
Sir how from the graph are we integrating this four n and three n at any specific point?

431
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,960
Pardon?

432
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,960
Yeah?

433
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,960
Like if you take any point on this line, how are you integrating that?

434
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,960
Okay there will be two n states, okay there will be four n states or something

435
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,960
Because we are talking about fermions, right?

436
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,960
Electrons up spin and down spin

437
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,960
Yes

438
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,960
So two states

439
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,960
No I mean if you take any random point on this

440
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,960
Yes

441
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,960
Like there is no like order in this thing

442
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:54,960
It would be like a state and then there will be something less than a state as you go along

443
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,960
This is a continuum right?

444
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,960
This is a continuum

445
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,960
Yes

446
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,960
So it could be anywhere in here right?

447
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,960
No I mean you like they say it is four n states and then after that eight n states and then two n states

448
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,960
So there is no order, so how are you pinpointing the number of

449
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,960
Because that arises from silicon matter

450
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,960
It is a result of a calculation, yes

451
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:18,960
Sir also is there any concept of kind of on purpose pushing or pulling the silicon atoms

452
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,960
In different distances for ideal value?

453
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,960
Okay now you have raised an important question that you didn't mean to

454
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,960
Strain silicon

455
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,960
Like if I take silicon and I grow it on a substrate

456
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,960
Which is lattice mismatched

457
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,960
What will that do?

458
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,960
Mismatched as an exfoliator

459
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,960
Like it either has a lattice constant larger than five or smaller than five

460
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,960
Compressive or tensile strain

461
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:46,960
Which means that I will be constructing one of these virtual silicons there

462
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,960
But at least within certain number of monolayers

463
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,960
Because I know what happens when I go further away from the interface

464
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,960
We already discussed it actually

465
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,960
There it basically relaxes to bulk whether through formation dislocations or not

466
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:58,960
Because

467
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,960
Because silicon you cannot force a bulk

468
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,960
Like a large piece of silicon into becoming virtual silicon of some sort

469
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,960
It will only mean certain number of layers that is impacted by that

470
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,960
Yes

471
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,960
Sir in the previous diagram you actually

472
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,960
You don't have to go back sir

473
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,960
Like when we had bonding and anti-bonding

474
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,960
There was a lower line for bonding electrons

475
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,960
And the upper line

476
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,960
So the two lines for the actual spacing that we have

477
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,960
Where we have force n states

478
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,960
And force n electrons

479
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,960
Those are for the bonding ones

480
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,960
Then there is the bandgap

481
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,960
And then the upper two are for the anti-bonding ones

482
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,960
Yeah so force n states and zero electrons

483
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,960
Yeah

484
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,960
Mind you force n states and zero electrons is something that would occur at absolute zero

485
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,960
Where there is no energy available for the electrons to go up the production band

486
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,960
You will discover that in like a couple of slides but I am just putting it out here

487
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,960
In this graph here you can see what is a virtual silicon and what is a real silicon

488
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,960
Dash line is the real silicon

489
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,960
The vertical dash line

490
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,960
That is it

491
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,960
Because that is the lattice distance at which silicon condenses

492
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,960
There is no other distance

493
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,960
But there are three dash lines

494
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,960
Oh they are just reference lines

495
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,960
They were just showing okay that in that particular period there is no gap

496
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,960
Pardon

497
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,960
I think you are referring to this neck over here right

498
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,960
Yeah

499
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,960
So this is also a virtual silicon

500
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,960
But importantly there is no bandgap

501
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,960
So that is why it is indicated in that

502
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:26,960
Sir is there

503
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,960
What is the use for virtual silicon?

504
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,960
I just mentioned

505
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,960
You got a straight layer of silicon

506
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,960
You will have to go

507
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,960
That is how the moment created

508
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,960
But are there like

509
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,960
Oh yes

510
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,960
The effective mass for instance is different for straight silicon

511
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,960
You might need it for some application

512
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:44,960
What about for a very small layer like say 10-20 layers of silicon

513
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,960
Is it useful practically like can you build and you know

514
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:54,960
I would say that almost all the modern devices basically they rely almost critically on those 10-20 layers

515
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,960
The bulk does not matter

516
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,960
Sir so the casual speed will be different in a screened or compressed silicon obviously

517
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,960
They will have different mobilities different bandgap everything is different

518
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,960
So which one actually has a faster speed is there like a general input or

519
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,960
No

520
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:15,960
So for instance it depends upon whether the scattering in that particular direction changes enough so as to go below the bulk silicon scattering or not

521
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,960
Will depend upon the material how it is trained by how much it is trained

522
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:24,960
And whether there are any dipole-dipole interactions because if the underlying material is polar

523
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,960
It will have an influence it will lead to dipole scattering also

524
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,960
So it is a complex question depends on each system

525
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:35,960
Sir so we can does that actually math exist like is it

526
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,960
Math is very hard

527
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:42,960
See this is a case of where math is extremely hard but experiments are relatively easy

528
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,960
And importantly they get you the result you want

529
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,960
So yeah

530
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:52,960
Sir so maybe we can come up with a theory to explain this

531
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,960
It depends

532
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:58,960
So how are these states defined there and I am not looking at that what is that important state

533
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,960
But if I didn't show it to you you will understand exactly

534
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:08,960
Sir why are in the left and the right half symmetric like there are two atoms that go in the middle

535
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,960
Yeah

536
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,960
So it is asymmetric because this is asymmetric

537
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,960
But that would be same

538
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,960
You never know

539
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,960
Look this is the offshore distance

540
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:28,960
So it is a measure of how close the two atoms get and how far away they go

541
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,960
It is not whether I am making the lecture right

542
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,960
I hope that is clear

543
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,960
I am saying I have got an aggregator number of atoms

544
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,960
Which come and condense at a distance r

545
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,960
You never know

546
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,960
Tell me what happens at a distance r

547
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,960
That is what this diagram is

548
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,960
I don't know

549
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,960
I don't know

550
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,960
I don't know

551
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,960
I don't know

552
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:48,960
I don't know

553
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,960
I don't know

554
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,960
I don't know

555
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:56,960
This is the continuous

556
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,000
I think this is the urgent

557
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,960
This is the region

558
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,960
Right

559
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:14,600
N refers to the number of atoms that is

560
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,960
Nobody asked me that question

561
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,960
Well that comes

562
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,960
. . . . . 다

563
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,900
These back lines?

564
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:22,440
These ones?

565
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,880
So this is just a distance at which

566
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,320
virtual silicon does not have a band.

567
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:31,020
The property of the material at that particular distance.

568
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,980
It is just that if I left things B,

569
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,760
it would never condense into this form.

570
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,020
But you could say

571
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,720
that by going by the definition of metal

572
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,720
that a silicon that condenses it

573
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,000
with this interatomic distance

574
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:43,740
would act as a metal.

575
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:45,600
Is this enough?

576
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,160
So what was N here?

577
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,600
Well, there is no gap.

578
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,600
It depends upon

579
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,060
at what energy you are injecting carriers into it.

580
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,040
If the energy is much below

581
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,760
this level,

582
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,200
then it will be insulated.

583
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,820
If I am injecting anywhere above this,

584
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:03,500
then that doesn't matter.

585
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,220
But why doesn't silicon exist

586
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,640
in that virtual region,

587
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,660
but it exists after that virtual region?

588
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,340
No, no.

589
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,660
Silicon exists only at this line.

590
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:14,860
Nowhere else.

591
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,740
Everything else is virtual here.

592
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:18,120
Okay.

593
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:21,980
So can I construct silicon

594
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,900
that is an iron

595
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:24,680
and a fiber?

596
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:26,540
See,

597
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,080
first of all,

598
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:30,000
the further away I go from this black line,

599
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,420
the harder it becomes to construct that.

600
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:31,820
Right?

601
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,060
Everybody will give me that?

602
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,600
So even if I do strained air epitaxy,

603
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,860
I am not going to go very far away

604
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:37,580
from that black line.

605
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,740
So whether you can reach that neck region

606
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,020
using strained air epitaxy,

607
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,340
so far there are no reports.

608
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,980
So what was the capital of the drop?

609
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:48,280
Yeah.

610
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,680
What was the number of?

611
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,680
I don't understand.

612
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,680
.

613
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,680
.

614
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,680
.

615
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,680
.

616
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,680
.

617
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,680
.

618
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,680
.

619
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,680
.

620
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,680
.

621
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,680
.

622
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,680
.

623
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,680
.

624
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,680
.

625
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,680
.

626
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,680
.

627
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,680
.

628
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,680
.

629
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,680
.

630
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,680
.

631
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,680
.

632
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,680
.

633
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,680
.

634
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,680
.

635
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,680
.

636
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,680
.

637
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,680
.

638
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:17,720
.

639
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,380
.

640
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:25,420
So another thing,

641
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,940
because of the Williams band being

642
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,740
a collection of

643
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,700
random orbitals

644
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,780
and the conduction band being a collection of

645
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:35,960
anti-warning orbitals,

646
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,660
at the dashed line,

647
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,480
real silicon,

648
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,740
six n states are in the 3T orbitals.

649
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,760
We can do that.

650
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:50,100
and 3s has 2n states

651
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,540
because s orbital carries only 2

652
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:54,520
so there is an asymmetry

653
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,600
in the number of states available

654
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,760
between valence and conduction

655
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:00,720
in general

656
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,800
that asymmetry will not show itself

657
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,240
because

658
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,620
as we will learn later when we change the x coordinate

659
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,280
of this plot

660
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:11,380
the energies that are needed to

661
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:14,000
run into a case where these 2n or 6n

662
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,720
are insufficient

663
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,620
in general it won't arise

664
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,260
the energies needed are just

665
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:21,860
your silicon crystal will disintegrate

666
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:22,640
before you get to 2n

667
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,560
so let's say

668
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,040
I start populating these states

669
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,780
how much energy do I need

670
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:31,440
to actually fill them all up

671
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,020
more than the band gap

672
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:36,060
because you see these states are in a continuum

673
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:38,000
which means you need the band gap

674
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,380
energy to reach the band edge

675
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:41,300
I need more energy to go above that

676
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,760
and that keeps on rising

677
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,000
you will have the exact mathematical formula

678
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:46,660
for that in a bit

679
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:51,560
so counting of occupied and unoccupied states

680
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:51,960
we have done

681
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,500
so now let's define some basics

682
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,580
of what you have learnt regarding band structure

683
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:58,000
now here is where x coordinates

684
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,680
of that plot become important

685
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,480
I am going to draw

686
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,180
2 different

687
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:05,020
pictures here

688
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:13,340
energy

689
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:19,160
so the previous graph was also in the transformed space

690
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:22,260
or that was in the non-real space

691
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,460
no that was in real space

692
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,380
I was in real space

693
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:26,640
this is now in transformed space

694
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,980
I am going to that

695
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:34,220
so you see E versus R

696
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,920
there is another way of actually plotting this

697
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,140
that is in dual space

698
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,300
E versus A

699
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:42,420
now this is where x coordinates become dual space

700
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,740
what question is this plot

701
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,760
what information does this plot give you

702
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,760
what is the energy of my electron

703
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,760
versus the separation between the two atoms

704
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,760
versus the separation between the two atoms

705
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,760
or if I have already got a grain of silicon

706
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,760
I have an electron

707
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,760
I want to track its energy as it pops from atom to atom

708
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,760
right

709
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,760
but the thing is the electron is moving in real space

710
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,760
here

711
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:10,760
so this is known as

712
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,260
band diagram

713
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:16,260
it's important to get these terminologies right

714
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:19,260
that's what a band diagram is

715
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,260
this one is in dual space now

716
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:23,260
E versus K

717
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,260
this still

718
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:27,260
if I ask myself the same question

719
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:30,260
the information I would get from this particular

720
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,260
you know

721
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:34,260
plot would be

722
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:37,260
how much energy does my electron have

723
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:40,260
depending on how fast it is moving

724
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,260
so what is the energy of the electron?

725
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,260
not always

726
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,260
not always

727
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,260
not always

728
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:47,260
I'll show you in a moment

729
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:50,260
this plot assumes that the band

730
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:52,260
I should put a name over here

731
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:54,260
this particular plot is known as

732
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,260
band structure

733
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,260
band structure

734
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:05,260
so band diagram and band structure have two different means

735
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:10,260
only if I'm very very close to the minimum of the conduction band

736
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,260
and I'll define that in a moment

737
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:17,260
the further away I go that's no longer true

738
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,260
okay

739
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:21,260
now let's talk about a direct band gap semiconductor

740
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,260
okay

741
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:32,260
so it is traditional to locate the top of the valence band at equal to zero

742
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:34,260
okay

743
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:38,260
and we always draw this as well as this

744
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,260
for increasing electron energies

745
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,260
okay

746
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,260
this is a convention

747
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,260
this is a convention

748
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,260
you can do it in any other way

749
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:46,260
by the way it will be perfectly correct

750
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:50,260
but you will have to add negative signs throughout your entire semiconductor

751
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:51,260
everywhere

752
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:53,260
see it's like a voltage right?

753
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:55,260
if you multiply this with charge

754
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:58,260
I actually get something that has the dimensions of a voltage
