0	8480	I can either say that my energy of the electron is minus E times E, because the electron charge is negative,
9100	13460	or I can say, okay, I'm going to forget about that negative sign, because it creates a mess for me,
14000	15900	and I'm going to just write it as E times E.
16660	19740	In semiconductors, we follow the E times E convention.
20740	28000	I don't know of a single textbook or a published piece of scientific literature where people do it the other way around.
28000	30860	But the connection band is drawn at the bottom.
31560	36920	The reason is that we generally associate higher energies with anti-bonding orbitals.
37080	38020	We just learned about that.
41260	51460	And since we actually associate that, we want to retain the idea of electrons being promoted to higher energy levels
51460	54000	as the system being in a higher energy state altogether.
55540	58000	So the convention in some sense is forced.
58000	59180	It comes from that natural requirement.
59720	61620	But there's nothing special about that convention.
62120	66260	It is just that this convention is so universal that it basically becomes a protocol.
67740	68080	Okay.
69960	74520	I locate the top of the Willans band at E equal to zero.
75600	82220	If I draw my band diagram now for real silicon, to that dashed line that you had,
85360	87600	my Willans band energy,
88000	92000	would be constant as a function of R.
92000	94000	Why?
94000	98000	I am in the middle of the bulk silicon, right?
98000	101000	My band gap should not change.
101000	103000	I'm inside the same material.
103000	105000	Would you put X mark over here?
105000	106000	Hm?
106000	107000	You are pulling an X mark over here.
107000	109000	I'm just giving you one part of it.
109000	111000	You'll see how radically different this is.
111000	112000	Sure.
112000	113000	Yeah.
113000	118000	So can we say that when I am having, say, in a continuous space,
118000	120000	I have two atoms, A and B,
120000	123000	even if I am changing their relative distance,
123000	130000	A and B and all such atoms exist at a distance that nature intended them to.
130000	131000	Yes.
131000	134000	So that means that distance is now fixed at five amps from the surface area.
134000	138000	So when we are actually varying R, we are just actually changing the reference at the end.
138000	141000	The coordinate of the electron that is free to move around.
142000	144000	That's the purpose of this particular part.
144000	147000	So R is the position of electron relative to the atoms?
147000	150000	Any arbitrarily chosen atom.
150000	153000	Because R equals zero in this case is not special.
153000	155000	It's somewhere in the semiconductor.
155000	160000	So where do we get to draw this diagram for ?
160000	165000	Well, it's useful for calculating electron energies because that's all that we are doing here.
165000	168000	So how do the electron energies distribute themselves?
168000	170000	Both this and this .
170000	173000	But there are different complementary pictures of that.
173000	175000	That's the question.
175000	176000	Okay.
176000	178000	So band-iron, yes.
178000	182000	Atom, you are talking about real silicon here.
182000	186000	We are looking at the R coordinate of the electron.
186000	188000	An electron that is free to move around.
188000	191000	Now if it is in the valence band, it's not free to move around.
191000	193000	It has the same energy no matter where you go in it.
193000	195000	Yes.
195000	197000	That is completely different from that.
197000	199000	That R is different from this R.
199000	200000	This is real silicon.
200000	204000	That was real silicon along a line and then all possible mathematical possibilities of that silicon.
204000	210000	There was a distance between the two silicon atoms.
210000	212000	Here is the position vector of the electron.
212000	216000	Is the position vector of the electron chosen from some other starting point?
216000	218000	Okay.
218000	222000	So the energy that I need to remain in the valence band,
222000	227000	the highest energy at which I remain in the valence band is the same regardless of where I am in the bulb.
227000	228000	Right?
228000	230000	That's my bonding energy.
230000	232000	Similarly, the energy,
232000	236000	the minimum energy at which the electron becomes free to move
236000	240000	is also the same regardless of where you are in the bulb.
240000	243000	So the band diagram is actually pretty simple.
243000	246000	It's two parallel lines.
246000	249000	Everybody understood that?
249000	251000	So can you explain the top line?
251000	253000	This is E C.
253000	255000	This is E V.
255000	260000	But you said that E C varies as we go higher and higher in the conduction band.
260000	262000	So there will be some bands here but we are not showing them.
262000	266000	We are showing the lowest possible energy where the electron can become free.
266000	268000	This is the band gap.
268000	274000	This distance is the band gap.
274000	279000	Any electron which is deeper in the bulb would have to go higher.
279000	281000	It would have to pick up more energy or move more.
281000	286000	Why don't we show the valence band and which is more negative,
286000	288000	the deeper we go into the valence band?
288000	290000	Yes.
290000	292000	So within the bulb,
292000	294000	for the electron is more or less the same.
294000	295000	That is what this diagram is.
295000	296000	That is the definition of bulk is.
296000	298000	Yes, so that is what the diagram is.
298000	301000	So the diagram is implicitly saying that every point in the bulb is equivalent.
301000	303000	That is only for the bulb.
303000	305000	At the surface, things change.
305000	307000	We won't do that.
307000	310000	You might say this is a pretty boring diagram.
310000	311000	Why bother with this at all?
311000	312000	It's just two parallel lines.
312000	315000	The thing is devices don't consist of a single bulb.
315000	318000	It consists of various things that are other than the bulb.
318000	320000	Other materials that they interface may be two contacts or whatever.
320000	321000	In which case,
322000	326000	this diagram would actually have discontinuities at both places.
326000	327000	And then,
327000	329000	now I would become special by the way.
329000	334000	Because how close or far away the electron is from that particular interface makes a difference.
334000	335000	But in the bulb,
335000	337000	it makes no difference whatsoever.
337000	338000	Okay, now let's talk about K,
338000	340000	which is a bit more interesting.
340000	345000	Sir, suppose if we had any subband like above EC and below EV,
345000	347000	what would that jump indicate,
347000	348000	let's say,
348000	350000	EV1 and EV3?
350000	351000	That would just indicate that
351000	352000	this electron,
352000	353000	let's say somewhere there,
353000	354000	is more strongly bound to the iron force,
354000	357000	it is less likely to ever get promoted to being a free electron.
357000	359000	Like an L-shell electron, for instance.
359000	362000	So could it become free by just jumping into EC?
362000	363000	Yeah.
363000	366000	So then what is the significance of that EC button?
366000	369000	EC is the lowest energy at which it can become free.
369000	371000	So where it would go to?
371000	373000	It would go to that same conduction band?
373000	374000	It will go to the conduction band,
374000	375000	or it could go to a point higher than that.
375000	377000	There would be other subband to this side as well.
377000	379000	That is very much different from this one.
379000	380000	They have different energies,
380000	381000	they have different mobilities.
381000	382000	I will define that later.
382000	383000	I spoke to some people.
383000	384000	.
384000	385000	.
385000	386000	.
386000	387000	.
387000	388000	.
388000	389000	.
389000	390000	.
390000	391000	.
391000	392000	.
392000	393000	.
393000	394000	.
394000	395000	.
395000	396000	.
396000	397000	.
397000	398000	.
398000	399000	.
399000	400000	.
400000	401000	.
401000	402000	.
402000	403000	.
403000	404000	.
404000	405000	.
405000	406000	.
406000	408000	.
408000	409000	.
409000	410000	.
410000	411000	.
411000	423000	.
423000	428000	.
428000	435000	.
435000	438000	.
438000	456680	I think somebody was saying parabolas here, so we do that only takes place near the edge
456680	460240	of the conduction band and we are in right there, so when you go far away it won't capture
460240	461240	the number of parabolas.
461240	466660	So I am drawing the conduction band now and this is where the real difference in silicon
466660	468660	and other materials become different.
468660	470660	Why does the energy decrease?
470660	472660	No, energy increases.
472660	478660	Energy increases because remember we are drawing this diagram for increasing electron energies,
478660	479660	conduction band.
479660	482660	In the valence band also the energies increase downwards.
482660	484660	That means it is more strongly bound.
484660	489660	But something else is less strongly bound and I have not defined that something else.
489660	495660	So an electron down here will be more strongly bound.
495660	496660	Sir, but then you know.
496660	502660	When it is more strongly bound why is the momentum more for that?
502660	505660	I will define this momentum in a bit and then it will become clear.
505660	509660	The momentum is not your normal momentum, it is what is known as the crystal momentum
509660	510660	but it is okay.
510660	517660	Sir, so if I say that if I am moving towards the bulk or away from the bulk then only my
517660	518660	k will change, right?
518660	521660	Because when I am moving along the bulk why should myâ€¦
521660	522660	Let me define k.
522660	524660	I am not defining k for you here.
524660	525660	What are the really important points?
525660	529660	See, here I did not need to define r because everything was constant, right?
529660	531660	And how many of you have watched Star Trek?
531660	532660	One, two.
532660	533660	You know the queue?
533660	534660	You remember that episode where they have that infinite road?
534660	535660	The road never ends.
535660	536660	That is basically the r existence.
536660	537660	It is very, very boring.
537660	538660	Everything is the same everywhere.
538660	539660	Okay.
539660	540660	This is a little bit different.
540660	541660	So this is the k.
541660	542660	This is the k.
542660	543660	This is the k.
543660	544660	This is the k.
544660	545660	This is the k.
545660	546660	This is the k.
546660	547660	This is the k.
547660	548660	This is the k.
548660	549660	This is the k.
549660	550660	This is the k.
550660	551660	This is the k.
551660	552660	This is the k.
552660	553660	This is the k.
553660	554660	This is the k.
554660	555660	This is the k.
555660	559660	So this is a valence band.
559660	563660	Now I define something known as first breline zone.
563660	567660	I will write it down here so that you guys can know this.
567660	578660	First.
578660	579660	Okay?
579660	582660	First breline zone, FEEZ.
582660	583660	denken WOMAN 2
583660	592660	This is the distance along positive k. By the way, this diagram is going to become significantly
592660	599660	more complicated. Right one is very simple. It's k in this direction, but we'll make it
599660	606660	more complicated in a bit. This is the distance of periodicity. This is the g vector that
606660	611660	we were referring to when we first started talking about dual space. This is the mod
611660	626660	of the g vector. Now, beyond this space, this diagram repeats itself. Now you understand
626660	636660	how this k thing is constructed? Each refers to a unit cell in k space. How do you define
636660	641660	a unit cell in k space? I think the unit cell in real space carry over its Fourier
641660	646660	transform or x-ray diffraction or whatever you have, and then you write down the corresponding
646660	655660	reciprocal relations here. Okay? So in that, as I get further and further away from the
655660	665660	center of the unit cell, my momentum naturally increases. Because what's my natural tendency?
665660	666660	You know, for a bound electron.
666660	672660	Stay within, you know, the bound state. Why do you need to go too far?
672660	674660	So could you please repeat what you used to say?
674660	681660	So as long as I have a bound electron, I have a certain punishment involved in trying to
681660	687660	stray too far away from my bound state. There's an energy barrier to overcome. So I need a
687660	695660	higher and higher momentum to actually overcome that. To pick up enough speed. In some sense,
695660	699660	you've got a neutron star and then there is a planet that is in its gravity. It requires
699660	704660	a lot of energy to get out. It's something similar to that.
704660	708660	Okay. Now how do I draw the conduction band? And this is where there's a little bit of
708660	714660	a head-scratching moment. Have you heard of things called direct and indirect bandgap
714660	720660	semiconductors? No? Okay. This diagram is what really defines that. I'll need to find
720660	723660	that. Just motivate this discussion.
723660	733660	If, if, notice the word if. My conduction band looks like this. If, where the bottom
733660	739660	of the conduction band and the top of the band are at the same k coordinate, chosen
739660	747660	to be k equal to zero for simplicity, then I have a direct bandgap semiconductor. Silicon
747660	751660	is not a direct bandgap semiconductor.
753660	761660	If the bottom of my conduction band and the top of my valence band are at the same k coordinate,
761660	767660	which we choose for convenience to be k equal to zero, then I have a direct bandgap semiconductor.
767660	773660	So what this statement says is that this is the bandgap then, because that's the definition
773660	782660	of what bandgap is. Right? Now, for silicon, so this is, should probably be a little bit
783660	789660	confused discussion otherwise.
789660	801660	I go to 0.85 FBZ. 85% of the way to the edge of the unit cell. And I'm not a forward direction
801660	810660	yet. The direction also matters. That complication will come later. I go up a distance EGR. From
810660	812660	this point, I draw a vertical line.
812660	813660	Wow.
813660	817660	And look at that point. That's the bottom of the conduction band.
817660	828660	It looks a little bit like this. My drawing is not so great, but yeah. That's silicon band
828660	835660	structure with only two bands. You were saying x coordinate matters.
835660	836660	Yeah, it does matter.
836660	842660	Okay. Now what does this mean practically? I'm just going to close with this example.
842660	849660	Which is basically answer a technological question for you. How do LEDs work?
849660	857660	Inject an electron and inject a counter carrier, which I'm going to call a hole in a lecture
857660	867660	or two. They recombine and they get a photon up. If k is momentum, this carrier at this
867660	871660	is the bottom of the conduction band here. And this electron, which is at the top of
871660	879660	the valence band here, has different momentum. How different? 0.85 FBZ. Your FBZ is the unit
879660	882660	of momentum. Okay?
882660	883660	Yes.
883660	885660	What is the momentum of a photon?
885660	888660	H by 3.
888660	891660	Momentum. Not energy.
891660	895660	H by lambda.
895660	897660	Energy divided by C, right?
897660	898660	Yes.
898660	899660	What is C?
899660	900660	Speed of light.
900660	901660	Speed of light.
901660	902660	How much? 2.992.
902660	910660	Very large number. So what is the momentum of a photon?
910660	918660	Close to 0. Right? Now, okay. I've got one particle here, one particle here. I want to
918660	924660	combine them and create another particle known as a photon. I must have energy conservation,
924660	927660	but I must also have momentum conservation.
927660	928660	Yes.
928660	934660	So, let's say an electron at momentum k have a basically, it's a hole, but okay,
934660	936660	a counter carrier at momentum 0.
936660	937660	Okay.
937660	940660	Net momentum of the initial state is what? 0.85 FBZ.
940660	941660	Half of it.
941660	944660	Final state is the photon, which has an energy 0 momentum.
944660	945660	Oh.
945660	951660	I can't satisfy that equation. That is the reason why silicon does not make good LEDs.
951660	955660	It goes back, it is basically the corollary of that thing I told you about earlier, that
955660	959660	silicon can be used to do some things, silicon will be used to do some things. This is an
959660	963660	example of the silicon cannot be used to do some things. This is why people bother about
963660	966660	gallium arsenide, gallium nitride and other direct bandgaps and other like this.
966660	971660	So, that's why you use direct conduction band rather than core .
971660	975660	We have to. We have to. How else do we use it at some momentum? So, let's figure out
975660	982660	a way how to do that. Let's say that my ideal direct bandgap points would have been here,
982660	992660	but this is silicon, so it is not here. So, I would basically have to find the process
992660	999660	which takes away that momentum from this electron and allows this recombination to take place.
999660	1005660	It's a pretty large momentum. And any horizontal transitions on this actually refer to something
1005660	1011660	I mentioned right at the beginning of this lecture, they refer to as phonons. Now, if
1011660	1012660	semiconductors have to do something like this.
1012660	1017660	So, if you have phonons with large energies available to 0.85 xz, this process would
1017660	1022660	happen. But phonon energies in most semiconductors are actually very, very small. They are in
1022660	1025660	milli electron volts, not electron volts either. Yes.
1025660	1031660	Sir, we could also like feasibly maybe combine like an electron along a vertical
1031660	1037660	grid. Is that also considered unfeasible? So, you see, if I extend this band further
1037660	1041660	by the way. Is that energy considered unfeasible? That energy is very, very high.
1041660	1042660	Okay.
1042660	1047660	I mean, yes, you could get like extreme UV emission or something, a deep UV emission
1047660	1052660	from silicon, but the efficiency would be so poor that it would not be worth making it.
1052660	1055660	So, anyhow, we will continue this very interesting discussion next time.
