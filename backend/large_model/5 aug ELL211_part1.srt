1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,620
Okay. So packaging and the fact that it

2
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:16,760
is the highest value in some sense,

3
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:22,720
what we are teaching in this class is

4
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,600
only what I would call

5
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,980
20 percent of the overall amount of materials.

6
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:31,220
This is not to say that this is just

7
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:37,140
some pre-designed bug that we just use as a standard package.

8
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:43,420
Packaging is used to be considered like an art in itself,

9
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:47,980
but now increasingly because of the heat issues,

10
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:50,260
people no longer speak about

11
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,780
integrated software in the package separately.

12
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:56,360
Instead, they talk about packaging of systems.

13
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,980
That means that

14
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:04,380
heat core design or thermal core design has to be a part of the IC design process itself.

15
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:07,300
Unfortunately, as far as I know,

16
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:11,340
only one course in any of the IITs in India,

17
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,960
IIT Bombay, actually teaches IC design in that way.

18
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,500
Even our VLSI design program over here,

19
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,840
talks about IC design in isolation more or less.

20
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,960
It doesn't make all the grammars. Can I help you?

21
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,960
Yes, please.

22
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,960
Okay.

23
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:31,260
See, if you can send all the stuff together at one point,

24
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,060
I'll be able to help you.

25
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,440
But if you keep coming every five minutes to interrupt me,

26
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,440
that's not really the problem.

27
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,540
Please, please, please don't.

28
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:46,540
So, the issue is that this kind of

29
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,480
fragmented knowledge forces people to take

30
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:53,460
electives in domains that they don't consider their own.

31
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,860
For instance, mechanical engineering has a big input here because heat transfer is

32
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:57,940
a central part of

33
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,220
that study.

34
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:05,520
As a part of the ISN-India's Immigration Commission,

35
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,340
the most publicly publicized part of this is

36
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:11,100
for me and I, could probably participate in initiative.

37
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:15,880
Which can also be a part of .

38
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:22,880
So, one of the lift well know concepts,

39
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,980
they have a lot of people going there.

40
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,040
I will try to figure out something out for you.

41
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:26,660
They remain at least one guysbelen beras in compliance with theceeding.

42
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:26,920
I would like to ask you that question recordings there.

43
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:26,980
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. No problem.

44
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:27,040
Okay. Thank you.

45
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,060
Yes.

46
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,220
Yes PuwaÅ‚...

47
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:27,240
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes followed by the Infrastructure Again.

48
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:27,620
Okay. Yes. Yes. Yes. Uh...black background and one of the rest publications

49
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:27,780
who is actually going there too?

50
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:37,780
I know parts of activism are even in the whole education system when it comes to this part of technology research and development.

51
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:46,780
And there, certain new VTech or MTech programs are going to be offered in a few years,

52
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:51,780
which are entirely geared about taking elements of various traditional practices of engineering

53
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:57,780
and offering them as, you know, semiconductor devices or something like that.

54
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:04,780
So this packaging issue is not just something that you can learn later on your own.

55
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:10,780
I recommend that if you are interested in going into this field, start looking for corresponding electives,

56
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:15,780
because you will not have the time to learn heat transfer from scratch after you've completed your VTech,

57
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:20,780
or you're late into your MTech, etc. It's just one of the matters.

58
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:21,780
Then we shall come back to this.

59
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,780
We'll start it, resume our discussion.

60
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,780
This part was prompted by a student question.

61
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:34,780
But then we resume our discussion on what happens to carrier wave functions in various kinds of materials,

62
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:39,780
starting from the understanding that only in a perfectly periodic crystal do you have black-hot scattering.

63
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:43,780
In any room temperature case, you will not have a perfect crystal.

64
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:50,780
You will have vibrations, which give rise to virtual particles known as phonons.

65
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:56,780
In a second quantization sense, interact with carriers, and that leads to scattering.

66
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:06,780
We defined an R-space, which is easy enough to understand, in one dimension, two dimensions, and three dimensions.

67
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:12,780
But there is a dual space to that, which arises from Fourier transforms, which is also periodic.

68
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:19,780
And if you are starting in the Bravais lattice, one of those 14 lattices,

69
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:24,780
then its dual space is known as a reciprocal lattice.

70
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:28,780
And the reciprocal lattice is guaranteed to be also a Bravais lattice.

71
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:34,780
Of course, there is no guarantee that Bravais lattice A maps into reciprocal lattice A.

72
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:42,780
It could be B, where B is also a set of initial Bravais lattices that we started with.

73
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,780
Then we had a simple class problem.

74
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:48,780
We defined planes, classes of planes.

75
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:53,780
We defined families of planes which are parallel to each other, or depending upon the nature of symmetry.

76
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:57,780
They may even be orthogonal, but they have the same symmetry in that direction.

77
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:05,780
The practical influence of understanding of planes is that it allows you to

78
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:11,780
please wafers without actually shattering them and losing a lot of material,

79
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:17,780
and also causing edge issues, because you want to use the entire real estate as much as possible.

80
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:20,780
We defined waferents in real space, corresponding to that,

81
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:25,780
because of the relationship between the periodicity r and the periodicity k,

82
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:32,780
is that if ikr, essentially, is equal to a constant, or 1, depending on your normalization,

83
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:35,780
is also a waferent.

84
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,780
So if r is a waferent, k is also a waferent.

85
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:40,780
That's the property of plane waves.

86
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:46,780
Then we formally defined the reciprocal lattice, and we expanded on the Fourier part.

87
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:51,780
Let's today connect this more to crystallography.

88
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:55,780
You've all seen Miller's analysis? Have you?

89
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,780
No.

90
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:03,780
So those of you who did coordinate geometry, and I think it was all of you in 11th grade,

91
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:07,780
you know how to write down the equation of a plane, right?

92
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:13,780
One of the canonical forms of the equation of a plane is a dot n equal to a constant, right?

93
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:16,780
Which is also the biggest discussion.

94
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:23,780
So, Miller indices, in that sense, are an exercise in finding the normal to the plane.

95
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:27,780
As long as you can write the normal to the plane, which is the equation of the plane effectively,

96
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,780
you can figure out where the indices are.

97
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:37,780
So, the area vector for a plane is picked to be parallel to the shortest reciprocal lattice vector.

98
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:45,780
So notice that, in coordinate geometry, the direction that is perpendicular to the plane is also in r3.

99
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,780
Right?

100
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:50,780
So, if you're starting with a plane arbitrarily oriented in r3,

101
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:53,780
then the vector that is perpendicular is also in r3.

102
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,780
But here we're making a departure from that.

103
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:01,780
We're saying that if you have a plane in real space,

104
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:09,780
then its vertical is a point in reciprocal space which has a k-position vector.

105
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:12,780
It's just a change of terminology. That is all there.

106
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,780
Let me repeat.

107
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:18,780
If you have a plane which is arbitrarily oriented in r3,

108
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,780
I find it's normal.

109
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:24,780
The coordinates, which is basically a triplet,

110
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:29,780
is a point in k-space.

111
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:30,780
Same coordinates.

112
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,780
So, let's say 3, 1, 5.

113
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:37,780
Those are coordinates in k-space for the dual vector.

114
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:40,780
So, if you have a plane in this direction, it maps to a point.

115
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,780
A position vector, to be more precise.

116
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:43,780
Yes?

117
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:47,780
You're taking the normal to that plane and then mapping it to a point in k-space.

118
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:50,780
You're just taking those coordinates and we will describe,

119
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:53,780
because obviously people who work in crystallography

120
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:56,780
are not very comfortable with working on Fourier analysis.

121
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,780
So, they have their own way of arriving at the same thing,

122
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:01,780
which I'll describe how to construct a Miller index.

123
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,780
It is essentially the same process.

124
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,780
If you have done a little bit of linear algebra,

125
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,780
which I believe you have done,

126
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:08,780
you can work out the steps and you'll say,

127
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,780
okay, yeah, these two treatments are exactly equivalent.

128
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:11,780
Sir, but for a plane like,

129
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,780
we can't only depend on one model vector.

130
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:14,780
We should also have a point, right?

131
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,780
So, we will have to consider that when doing this.

132
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:17,780
Which point?

133
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,780
Meaning, if you have a normal vector,

134
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,780
infinite planes which have a normal vector.

135
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:22,780
Yeah.

136
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,780
So, all you say is that if I define its normal vector,

137
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,780
any normal which is a scalar multiple of that normal vector

138
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,780
will also serve as a normal vector.

139
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,780
What we're trying to find over here is the minimum normal vector.

140
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,780
But I'm telling you that if there are infinite planes

141
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:34,780
for the same normal vector, right?

142
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:35,780
Yes, yes, yes.

143
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:39,780
So, this basically goes back to our previous discussion,

144
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:43,780
where families of planes corresponded to a single point in k-space.

145
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:44,780
Okay.

146
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,780
So, how do you construct a family of planes

147
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,780
that are all parallel to each other?

148
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:51,780
So, that discussion is exactly equivalent.

149
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:54,780
So, you pick a parallel,

150
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:57,780
but you pick the shortest reciprocal lattice vector

151
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:02,780
and let us express that in three unit coordinates,

152
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,780
or rather three unit vectors,

153
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,780
in the linear space defined by b1, b2, b3,

154
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,780
which I have bolded there.

155
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,780
How do you construct it?

156
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,780
It is the smallest integral coefficient

157
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:17,780
in reciprocal space.

158
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:21,780
So, you basically write it as,

159
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:25,780
so if you have like this coordinate system in,

160
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,780
I think, red or black?

161
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:28,780
Yeah, black.

162
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,780
It is in real space.

163
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,780
Then you construct a coordinate system in red.

164
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:37,780
That is the corresponding coordinate system in k-space.

165
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:40,780
So, they are not, so black is r3,

166
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,780
red is k3.

167
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,780
And we are finding out

168
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:49,780
the corresponding minimum intercepts

169
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:54,780
a by h, b by k and c by l.

170
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,780
And we are trying to find out h, k and l,

171
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,780
which are the smallest integers

172
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,780
which will make this possible.

173
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:03,780
So, for instance, you have got 7 by 11 or something.

174
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:07,780
Then 11 is the corresponding, you know,

175
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,780
coordinate I have to worry about.

176
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,780
Can you repeat it?

177
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:15,780
So, what we are trying to do over here is,

178
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,780
we are trying to find out coordinates in b-space,

179
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,780
which is, you know, effectively mapping of k-space,

180
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,780
h, k, l,

181
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:25,780
so that you have b by,

182
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:28,780
you are finding h, k and l,

183
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:31,780
so that they are the smallest possible integer multiples

184
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:32,780
in each direction.

185
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:33,780
Yeah?

186
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,780
The numbers you said.

187
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:36,780
Yeah?

188
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:39,780
The numbers you said, 7, 5, 11, I didn't get.

189
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:40,780
So, we will give you a worked example.

190
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:47,780
You will probably understand from that more clearly.

191
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,780
So, crystallographic definition,

192
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,780
which is independent of, you know,

193
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,780
Fourier definition is that

194
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,780
it is the inverse proportionality of intercepts in real space.

195
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,780
So, for instance,

196
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,780
if I have an arbitrarily oriented plane,

197
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,780
which has intercepts,

198
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:06,780
let's say x1, x2, x3,

199
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,780
then the corresponding 1 over x1,

200
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:09,780
1 over x2,

201
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:10,780
1 over x3,

202
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,780
expressed in smallest integer form,

203
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:16,780
will be the corresponding h, k, l's.

204
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,780
I take the inverse,

205
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:21,780
and I find out the l, c, m, in some sense,

206
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:22,780
for those,

207
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,780
and those are h, k, l's,

208
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:27,780
with no bound factors.

209
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:31,780
So, for hexagonal and robohedral lattices,

210
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,780
it is more convenient to use four indices,

211
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:36,780
even though we are not talking about a four-dimensional space,

212
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,780
because there is an additional axis,

213
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,780
which is a c-axis in the road direction,

214
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,780
you would present that using the fourth index.

215
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:45,780
This is just specific to these two crystal structures.

216
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:46,780
It is not necessary,

217
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,780
it is entirely possible to express it in three,

218
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:49,780
because it's after all,

219
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,780
after a k3, you don't need more than that,

220
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:54,780
but you can have an over-determined plane,

221
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:55,780
for instance.

222
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:56,780
It is equivalent to saying that,

223
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,780
okay, I've got three non-polar points,

224
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,780
and they define my plane,

225
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,780
and I just happen to pick another fourth point

226
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,780
on the same plane to define my plane.

227
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:07,780
Makes no difference, really speaking.

228
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,780
So, why do we do that?

229
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:12,780
It's easier to express it,

230
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:16,780
because there are, you know, additional axes here.

231
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:17,780
So, let's do a class problem,

232
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:20,780
and that will hopefully clear up some of these doubts.

233
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,780
So, here is the problem.

234
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,780
This plane in red, light red,

235
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:27,780
I hope everybody can see that.

236
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,780
It has these points defined,

237
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,780
a and b,

238
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:32,780
and the Miller indices,

239
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,780
for this indicated plane.

240
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:41,780
All right, so how many of these,

241
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:42,780
what you heard is just one point.

242
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:45,780
You'll remember again and again from our Himalayan class,

243
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,780
were also an episode three.

244
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,780
Sir, did I also drink another body of water?

245
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:50,780
Yeah.

246
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:53,780
That's obvious, right?

247
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:59,780
Because Z cure is 0 in both cases.

248
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:37,760
Thank you.

249
00:13:37,780 --> 00:14:07,760
Thank you.

250
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:37,760
Thank you.

251
00:14:37,780 --> 00:15:07,760
Thank you.

252
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:37,760
Thank you.

253
00:15:37,780 --> 00:16:07,760
Thank you.

254
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:37,760
Thank you.

255
00:16:37,780 --> 00:17:07,760
Thank you.

256
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:37,760
Thank you.

257
00:17:37,780 --> 00:18:07,760
Thank you.

258
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:37,760
Thank you.

259
00:18:37,780 --> 00:19:07,760
Thank you.

260
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:37,760
Thank you.

261
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:41,720
of irrational points, like it could occur.

262
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,280
Of course, we have got non-periodic systems

263
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,880
like polycrystalline and morpher systems,

264
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,280
they're not periodic either.

265
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:52,280
Those are non-irrational examples of non-periodic systems.

266
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,880
So for the non-periodic system,

267
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,780
we cannot define the Fourier transform

268
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,820
or there are no .

269
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,980
Well, how would you calculate

270
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:04,720
a Fourier transform in practicality?

271
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,520
You would do something like a DFT,

272
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,020
a speed Fourier transform.

273
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:10,780
Or we can do it for some, within a particular domain,

274
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,920
we can calculate the Fourier transform

275
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,120
for as long as we know the values, right?

276
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,680
But you'll always have a scatter.

277
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,560
Because I'll have basically kind of an excellent data process

278
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,280
which never terminates, right?

279
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,220
I say that, okay, this point lies between this and this,

280
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,320
and you say, no, it's actually finer than that,

281
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,920
it's finer than that, and the process never concludes.

282
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:36,380
So ask yourself, how do I construct this crystal?

283
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,820
Can you place it at that point?

284
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:44,580
And that that point is not well defined, right?

285
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:52,320
Okay, so now let's connect wave function, this structure.

286
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,760
I mentioned this expression

287
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,760
when we talked about two different energy regimes,

288
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:00,360
where Uwm is the cell function,

289
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,280
which is the part of the wave function

290
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:05,480
that represents the strong interaction between an electron,

291
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,520
and an .

292
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,700
and the second part

293
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,740
is a familiar plane wave

294
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,860
so if you had

295
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,460
open, like you know

296
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,700
the universe constructed of

297
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,100
an infinite space

298
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,340
and only one electron

299
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:25,360
e to the power ikr would be a sufficient

300
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,280
representation of what that electron wave function

301
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,340
would be, right, because it doesn't interact

302
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,760
with anything because nothing else exists

303
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,020
in fact, John Archibald

304
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,380
was a physicist

305
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:37,100
was a PhD advisor of Richard Feynman

306
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,340
he had this theory that there is only

307
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,320
one electron in the entire universe and everything else

308
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,080
is a motion transferred copy of that

309
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,600
pretty crazy idea

310
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,280
but it seems to fit the facts

311
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,240
so

312
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,320
the cell function of the kernel

313
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,360
is what we are defining as

314
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,420
u sub n, it interacts with the lattice

315
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:59,120
crystals

316
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,460
this is important to understand that even though

317
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,040
we talk about

318
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,220
crystals having symmetry

319
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:06,740
but the act of construction of the crystal

320
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,260
actually breaks space symmetry

321
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,980
because space symmetry says that all directions

322
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:11,920
in R3 are equivalent

323
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,660
so once I construct a crystal

324
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,940
I say that okay, some directions are more special

325
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:17,480
than others

326
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,820
and as a result, first of all there is symmetry breaking

327
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:23,000
that occurs, so all directions are not

328
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,760
equivalent, so this for example

329
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,300
is a diamond crystal lattice

330
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,740
which is what silicon and germanium

331
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:29,460
condense into

332
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:32,440
so just there as an example

333
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,840
so what does that depend upon?

334
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:38,540
each will break symmetry in one way or the other

335
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:42,980
once you have a crystal then there is periodicity

336
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,840
but when you say periodicity

337
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,060
and you try to construct a miller index

338
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:49,060
you are still saying that there are at least

339
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,240
three special directions

340
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,080
periodicity is different from symmetry

341
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:59,240
periodicity is what I would say

342
00:22:59,240 --> 00:22:59,700
okay

343
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:02,860
I think there is a slight abuse of terminology over here

344
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:07,780
what we are talking about basic symmetry in R3 is

345
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:08,940
isotropicity of space

346
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,420
that all directions are equivalent

347
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:12,620
the moment I impose a crystal

348
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:15,600
that basic R3 symmetry is broken

349
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,720
and we say that the resulting space is anisotropic

350
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,060
and now within that

351
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,980
anisotropic space we have got periodicity

352
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,880
and that periodicity

353
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,280
in the sense of a group theory

354
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,500
obviously imposes a certain set of

355
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,960
special directions in which there is

356
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,180
periodicity and hence

357
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,220
that is symmetry

358
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,200
so we are using

359
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,700
symmetry in two different terms

360
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,400
in two different ways

361
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:36,960
they are actually

362
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,920
it is correct to use the word symmetry over here

363
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,380
because R3 symmetry is the basic symmetry of all

364
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,620
which is basically

365
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,500
I think it is called

366
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,400
n-fold or something

367
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,260
okay never mind

368
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,040
what it is called

369
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,960
it is been a while since I have read these things

370
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,960
but

371
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,600
isotropicity

372
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,020
and symmetry combined together

373
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,860
those two terms will actually clarify

374
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,180
what we are talking about

375
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,680
so isotropicity is broken

376
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,180
which is also known as R3 symmetry

377
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:03,220
so it is like when you didn't have a crystal

378
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:04,140
that any vectoring

379
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,520
R3 was equally probable

380
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:09,460
or there was no special energy direction anywhere

381
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:10,620
so when you impose a crystal

382
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:13,880
so that say a particular direction became more favourable for that crystal

383
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,380
more favourable or less favourable

384
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,120
less favourable

385
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,260
and non-equivalent basically

386
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:19,040
that is what we are trying to say

387
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,840
what is the fact that over here

388
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,280
the kernel is u sub n

389
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,560
I call it the self-function

390
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:30,160
and it is also known as kernel in many treatments

391
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,620
now mobility

392
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:32,400
I have still not

393
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,060
I have not defined mobility please note

394
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,620
I have not given the units of mobility

395
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,100
I have not defined what unity is

396
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,260
mobility is in

397
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,660
you know what is the right-hand side of that equation

398
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,060
but mobility we

399
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,620
can right now state

400
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:48,900
it is the measure of how easy it is for a carrier to move

401
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,860
carrier or electron?

402
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:51,620
electron is a carrier

403
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:54,260
there is going to be a second carrier introduced to this discussion

404
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:57,560
that I am generalizing into a carrier

405
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:00,100
so it is a strong function of scattering interactions

406
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:02,120
the more scattering you have

407
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,860
the harder it is for the carrier to move

408
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:04,560
right?

409
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,200
can everybody understand that?

410
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:11,020
okay

411
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:14,160
so one thing that happens in this entire process is that

412
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,320
we start with the assumption that electron for instance

413
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,760
has a mass of 9.11

414
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,520
10 to the power minus 31 kilograms

415
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,500
in semiconductor devices

416
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,400
we don't use that mass much

417
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,700
instead we replace it with something called an effective mass

418
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,560
and I will describe two ways

419
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:33,900
two distinct and two distinct ways in which that is constructed

420
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:36,560
so that is what I am

421
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:40,120
so is that because of rest mass or moving mass?

422
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,420
no

423
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:43,120
that is relativity

424
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,360
in that case if your speed goes up the mass goes up

425
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,420
no that is not what you are talking about

426
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,800
so let us now

427
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,620
describe the first of those two masses

428
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,860
there are two ways of defining effective mass

429
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:55,200
both are necessary for you to understand

430
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,520
because both are needed in different contexts

431
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,220
so let us first define a kinematic effective mass

432
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:02,920
so when a carrier moves through crystal it interacts with what?

433
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,600
so when a carrier moves through crystal it interacts with what?

434
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,740
the lattice

435
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,940
that is the obvious culprit right?

436
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,360
other carriers

437
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:11,940
electron-electron interactions or hole-hole interactions

438
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,260
and also stuff that should not be there

439
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:16,060
impurities

440
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:17,100
Joukalski process

441
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,400
carbon impurities in silicon

442
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,060
that is what we are talking about

443
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:25,160
it is very different from free space transport

444
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:29,900
so if we write down the equation of motion

445
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:33,000
notice that I have pulled m inside the derivative

446
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:33,500
ok?

447
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,640
because I am writing the rate of change of momentum there

448
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,340
is equal to three different forces

449
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,800
one is the externally applied force

450
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,300
so this could be a piece of silicon

451
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,060
and apply an electric field across it

452
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,460
that is an external force

453
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,600
the other is periodic force

454
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,400
I have got a crystal

455
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:53,040
the carrier moving in one direction is going to see the same kind of scattering

456
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,740
or roughly the same kind of scattering

457
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:56,760
modulo the temperature differences

458
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,540
as it hops from place to place

459
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:01,900
because the lattice structure of it is periodic in itself

460
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:02,640
and other?

461
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,440
unexpected things

462
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,240
like electron-electron interactions

463
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,980
after all it is not a single electron system

464
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:13,040
and the other thing is impurities

465
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,500
which break periodicity by the way

466
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,200
because if I have silicon

467
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,980
and I suddenly introduce a phosphorus atom in there

468
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:23,640
which is where you actually make n-type silicon

469
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,940
phosphorus has a different valency and a different covalent bonding

470
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:27,780
than silicon does

471
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,580
so it will disrupt the electron cloud

472
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,640
and break periodicity in that sense

473
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,480
ok sir can I ask a question?

474
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,540
periodicity what does that mean?

475
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:38,340
periodic is like if you have got an infinite silicon crystal

476
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:41,380
so if your electron is moving in a single direction

477
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:44,520
without getting captured in different directions

478
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:47,040
it is going to encounter the same kind of collisions

479
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,940
you know roughly

480
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:49,880
a given unit of time

481
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,180
like it is moving at a constant velocity

482
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:51,840
it is going to take time

483
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,880
we are just accounting it for the lattice forces

484
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,640
yes

485
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,340
just that f periodic is lattice

486
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,080
but the lattice may contain impurities

487
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,180
and that impurity part is an extra layer

488
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:01,880
so what?

489
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:06,580
so when we say periodic do we also account for lattice vibrations being the same?

490
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,580
no we don't

491
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:11,080
we in fact I mentioned that earlier in this lecture

492
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,840
we replace vibrations with the quasi particles

493
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,740
and then that would get pushed into f other

494
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:21,080
because f other contains everything else that is not a part of the perfect lattice

495
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,740
or an externally invited force

496
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:28,140
now how do you track the motion of any carrier?

497
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,320
one electron?

498
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,040
I read on the equation of motion I tried to track that one electron?

499
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:31,540
one electron? I read on the equation of motion I tried to track that one electron?

500
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:37,940
see those of you who were getting a slight sense of Deja Vu

501
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:40,180
from maybe 10th grade or 11th grade

502
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:42,080
where you started talking about how

503
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:46,440
solid bodies can be replaced with a single centre of mass

504
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,540
and treat it as a particle

505
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:51,480
this direction this discussion is going to be somewhat similar

506
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,440
in spirit

507
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,540
not in detail

508
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:55,600
so

509
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,400
we're gonna say okay this is external force acting on it

510
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,280
this is a force acting on it from the lattice itself and this is from everything else, right?

511
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,380
I can't do it, right?

512
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:00,900
if I can't do it, no problem!

513
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:01,400
I can't do it, right?

514
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:13,540
Well, that's easy enough to do for one particle. If you have any silicon crystal, let's say

515
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:21,540
containing a mole of silicon atoms, like Avogadro number, do you write down 10 to the power

516
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:26,540
of 53 such equations? No. See, it's the same kind of reasoning as you use for the rigid

517
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:35,540
bodies. So, mathematically that problem is intractable. So, what I do instead is that

518
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:46,540
we modify the definition of mass itself. So, I replace m0 with mn star, n refers to electron.

519
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:51,540
This is going to be a kind of protocol going forward. n refers to electron and t refers

520
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:56,540
to hole. We will come to a hole in a short while. So, what refers to star? Star is the

521
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:58,540
particle indicating that it's not your normal mass. It's an effective mass.
